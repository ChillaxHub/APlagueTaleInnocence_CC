00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:44.160
- MÉLIE: Right now, we have to hide.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.933
Arthur and I know a place.

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:48.359
- AMICIA: And Lucas?

00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:51.875
- MÉLIE: He's waiting at your château.
All in good time.

00:00:51.973 --> 00:00:54.492
- HUGO: We're going to see Lucas again?
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:58.945
I hope so.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.312

Let's keep moving. We're not safe yet.

00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:16.973
Would you mind moving on?

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:20.949
Tell me...

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.948
What the hell are you doing
with The Inquisition after you?

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:26.011
What's so special about the little guy?

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:28.605
- AMICIA: It's... complicated.

00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:31.246
And what about your brother?
Will he be alright?

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.527
- MÉLIE: He'll catch up with us.

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:35.558

- MÉLIE: Hey...

00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:38.333
Don't get all lovey dovey.

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:40.511
He'll break your poor little heart.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.152
- AMICIA: I... I-I... No.

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.168
- HUGO: Hey, a mill!

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.761
- MÉLIE: Yeah, we're going to use it to cross.

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:49.991
- HUGO: Wow...

00:01:55.793 --> 00:01:57.473
Oh, what are those birds?

00:01:57.746 --> 00:01:59.026
- AMICIA: Ducks.

00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:00.333
- HUGO: Oh...

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:02.317
Like... the ones we eat?

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:03.558
- AMICIA: Yes...

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:05.980
And they eat frogs. That's live.

- MÉLIE: I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:11.090

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.411
- MÉLIE: Is he always...

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:24.833
...like that?

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:27.090
- AMICIA: He hasn't seen much of the world.

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:30.084
- MÉLIE: This isn't the best moment to start.

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:34.158
- HUGO: First one to mill wins.
- AMICIA: Hey, slow down!

00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:36.730
- HUGO: It's closed.

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:38.393
- MÉLIE: I'll do it.

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:44.918
It's opened.

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:06.761
- HUGO: Oh, a big wheel!

00:03:06.824 --> 00:03:09.358
- AMICIA: It's for crushing the wheat.

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:22.386
- MÉLIE: (SIGHS) The current is too strong.

00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.511
- HUGO: How are we going to get across?

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.855
- MÉLIE: By stopping it.
- HUGO: And how are we going to stop it?

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:31.334
- MÉLIE: Amicia...
- AMICIA: We'll find a way.

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:36.933

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:42.199
(CRANKING)

00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:44.933

00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:52.418
- AMICIA: It's working!
- HUGO: Yay!

00:03:52.528 --> 00:03:54.527
- MÉLIE: All we have to do now is cross over.

00:03:54.574 --> 00:03:57.418
- HUGO: Amicia, you're not leaving without me, are you?

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.027
- AMICIA: I'm coming, Hugo.
I'm just trying to find a way to get you across.

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.921
- MÉLIE: (CHUCKLES) You sound like Arthur.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.766

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.173

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.355
- AMICIA: And there you go! See! Simple.

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:42.870
- MÉLIE: If The Inquisition make it this far,
that'll hold them up for a while.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.143
- AMICIA: (EFFORT GRUNT)

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:56.167

00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:57.916
...through here.

00:04:58.167 --> 00:04:59.167
Come on.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.823
- MÉLIE: Are you trying to impress me or what?

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:02.588
- AMICIA: No.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.557
- MÉLIE: Alright, come on.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.820
- HUGO: It's pretty here.
And it smells like earth.

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:10.729
The <i>ah-kee-duct</i>, is that where Lucas is?

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:11.604
- AMICIA: I hope so.

00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.151
- MÉLIE: I doubt this castle is going to look like much.

00:05:14.198 --> 00:05:14.854
- AMICIA: Why?

00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:16.667
- MÉLIE: This used to be a village.

00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:20.276
But it was reduced to rubble
in just one night, years ago.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.729
Some says that there's a curse around these parts.

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:23.885
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.401
- AMICIA: She's joking, Hugo.

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:26.901
- MÉLIE: Of course, I am.

00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:29.517
Since when do I say anything true, eh?

Hugo, look at me.

00:05:53.413 --> 00:05:56.069
Is it starting again, your head?

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:06.798
MÉLIE: Don't say he's been bitten.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.298
- AMICIA: It's not The Bite.
It's something in his blood since he was little.

00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:12.594
I'll have to carry him.

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.073
Climb on my back if you can.
Come on.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.360

- MÉLIE: If it's in his blood...

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.955
What about you?
- AMICIA: I'm fine.

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:28.376
Lucas is trying to slow the effect down.

00:06:28.408 --> 00:06:30.875
That's also why we go to the château.

00:06:31.752 --> 00:06:33.112
- HUGO: Amicia...

00:06:33.924 --> 00:06:34.924
I'm scared.

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:36.158
- AMICIA: Of what, Hugo?

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:37.595
- HUGO: What's in my head.

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:40.892
- MÉLIE: Don't worry.
We're all scared of what's in our heads.

00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:41.955
Here we are.

00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:43.885
You'll be able to rest.

- HUGO: Oh...

00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:09.251
Is this your house?
- MÉLIE: It's a hideout, lad.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.151
It's meant for hiding out not banquets with Lords and Ladies.

00:07:13.643 --> 00:07:15.003
Don't touch that!

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.440
It's my brother's

00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:18.286
That's worth a lot, that is.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:22.345
- AMICIA: How long have you been living like this?

00:07:22.393 --> 00:07:24.861
- MÉLIE: Like ruffians and beggars, you mean?

00:07:24.893 --> 00:07:26.253
Family tradition.

00:07:26.643 --> 00:07:28.486
Our dad was a piece of rubbish.

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.470
Tried to beat us one time too many so we skidaddled.

00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:33.689
But you... You're almost royalty.

00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:35.986
- AMICIA: Royalty? Huh.
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:37.658

- HUGO: I'm cold.

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:43.203
- AMICIA: Can't you see? Look at us.
We've lost everything.

00:07:43.235 --> 00:07:45.859
- MÉLIE: What'd you mean?
Who's going to pay us then?

00:07:45.907 --> 00:07:47.594
- AMICIA: What're you talking about?

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:51.312

What'd you reckon?
- LUCAS: You're right. Let's just go.

00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:26.119
Let's keep going.

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:27.782
The château shouldn't be far now.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.308
- MÉLIE: Let's go. Come on.
It's not far to the aqueduct.

00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:35.058
- LUCAS: Seems like you've been through
some tough times.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.708
- MÉLIE: (SCOFFS) You don't say.
You forgot to tell  us about the Inquisition.

00:17:38.764 --> 00:17:40.527
- LUCAS: You wouldn't have accepted the deal.

00:17:40.628 --> 00:17:42.224
- MÉLIE: The one where your friends are rich?

00:17:42.414 --> 00:17:43.775
- LUCAS: We'll sort it out.

00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:45.831
- MÉLIE: Tell my brother that.

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:51.275
(RANING SOUND)
(CHILLING MUSIC PLAYING)

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:54.277
What's all this?
- LUCAS: An accident?

00:17:59.188 --> 00:18:01.509
- AMICIA: An Inquisition cart.
- LUCAS: Rats...

00:18:01.554 --> 00:18:04.478
- MÉLIE: There must be things
we can salvage from inside.

00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:06.587
- AMICIA: I don't see how we can get past.

00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:07.860
- LUCAS: Oh, Amicia!

00:18:07.938 --> 00:18:09.618
I have something for you.

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:13.195
It's a by-product of Ignifer — Luminosa.

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:16.242
You throw it in a pile of rats and...

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:17.793
Anyway, you'll see it...

00:18:17.894 --> 00:18:19.014
Here, take it.

00:18:20.405 --> 00:18:22.538
Saltpatre, alcohol, and leather.

00:18:22.827 --> 00:18:24.267
Mix them together.

00:18:24.534 --> 00:18:25.829
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.896
- LUCAS: Throw it to the rats.

00:18:30.907 --> 00:18:31.822
Boom!

00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:32.878
Luminosa!

00:18:32.927 --> 00:18:34.612
- HUGO: Ah... My eyes sting.

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:37.815
- MÉLIE: (CHUCKLES) It completely destroyed them.

00:18:45.673 --> 00:18:48.864
- AMICIA: Lucas, the cart is packed
full of alchemical materials.

00:18:48.887 --> 00:18:50.487
- LUCAS: Make sense.

00:18:50.751 --> 00:18:51.933
The Inquisition...

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:56.283
They couldn't have got as far as the Macula
without reading the alchemical writings.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.483
I don't know what they're up to.

00:18:58.582 --> 00:19:01.908
But whatever it is, these carts will be useful.

00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:04.329
- HUGO: The <i>ah-kee-duct</i>! We're nearly there!

00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:05.546
- LUCAS: Finally...

00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:07.736
We're going to find out at last.

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:14.284
- AMICIA: I'll help you up.
- HUGO: Alright.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.245
Let's go up the <i>ah-kee-duct</i>!

00:19:20.301 --> 00:19:22.153
- AMICIA: Hugo, it's <i>a-kwuh-duct</i>

00:19:22.187 --> 00:19:23.187
- HUGO: Oh.

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:25.323
<i>Ah-Kwuh-Duct</i>

00:19:25.803 --> 00:19:26.803
Aqueduct!

00:19:29.508 --> 00:19:31.628
- LUCAS: Mélie, where're your brother?

00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.503
- MÉLIE: I don't want to talk about it.

00:19:33.593 --> 00:19:34.564
- LUCAS: Er...

00:19:34.587 --> 00:19:35.587
Al-Alright.

00:19:47.388 --> 00:19:48.508
- HUGO: Wow...

00:19:48.738 --> 00:19:50.418
- MÉLIE: Well spotted.

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:56.259
- AMICIA: Come on. Get up there.
- HUGO: Yes.

00:20:02.857 --> 00:20:04.057
- AMICIA: What?

00:20:04.553 --> 00:20:05.553
Is that it?

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:08.392
There's nothing here. Lucas, I...

00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:11.695
Don't tell me we've done all this for nothing.

00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:13.314
- LUCAS: No! No, no.

00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:15.747
Laurentius was smarter than that.

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:18.191
It was alchemist's trick.

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:21.372
<i>"Gold is born from lead...</i>

00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:25.935
<i>The door shall only reveal itself

00:20:26.093 --> 00:20:27.399
Something like that.

00:20:27.444 --> 00:20:29.541
- MÉLIE: Hm... I prefer...

00:20:34.352 --> 00:20:35.736
Who's going first?

00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:37.221
- LUCAS: Nice one.

00:20:37.265 --> 00:20:38.305
Uh... Amicia?

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:41.070
- AMICIA: Come on, then.
We've come this far.

00:20:41.104 --> 00:20:42.784
- MÉLIE: That's my girl!

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:49.639
- HUGO: Oh, wow!

00:20:52.332 --> 00:20:54.162
- AMICIA: Oh!
- MÉLIE: (WHISTLES)

00:20:54.475 --> 00:20:55.475
Not bad.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.514
- HUGO: Is that... the sea?

00:20:57.544 --> 00:21:00.300
- LUCAS: No, it's water that's collected underground.

00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:02.026
Hey, there's a pontoon.

00:21:02.723 --> 00:21:06.695
- AMICIA: People used to use this place.
We're on the right track!

00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:19.296
- MÉLIE: I've... never heard of it before.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.524
- HUGO: And the château?

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:21.450
Where is it?

00:21:21.495 --> 00:21:25.870
- LUCAS: Well, if you want to know,
we have to get across first.

00:21:27.946 --> 00:21:28.946
Well done!

00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:43.905
A reaction ferry.

00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:44.586
- AMICIA: A what?

00:21:44.631 --> 00:21:47.577
- LUCAS: A boat that's propelled
by a rope, you pull it by hand.

00:21:47.846 --> 00:21:49.846
- MÉLIE: There's a hand crank.

00:21:57.678 --> 00:21:59.745
- AMICIA: Can you do it, Mélie?

00:22:00.189 --> 00:22:03.481
- MÉLIE: Lucas! Come and help instead of sleeping.

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:04.954
- LUCAS: Er... Yes, yes.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.495
- HUGO: The water is green.

00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:08.972
- LUCAS: That's because there're lots of things living in it.

00:22:09.017 --> 00:22:10.434
- HUGO: They must be very cold.

00:22:10.502 --> 00:22:13.459
- AMICIA: Once, Father took us to the lake at Tourves.

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:15.780
And I slipped, and fell in the water.

00:22:15.825 --> 00:22:17.959
It was so cold that made me cry.

00:22:18.013 --> 00:22:20.724
- HUGO: (LAUGHS) I would've cried too.

00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.966
- MÉLIE: Your boat awaits.

00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:26.707
- HUGO: Shall I get in?
- AMICIA: Yes, Hugo, get in.

00:22:26.742 --> 00:22:28.742
- MÉLIE: I hope they can swim.

00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:34.101
Hold on tight.

00:22:34.164 --> 00:22:35.204
There you go!

00:22:35.592 --> 00:22:36.592
- HUGO: Wow!

00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:40.882
I can't see any fish.

00:22:40.972 --> 00:22:42.735
- AMICIA: Oh... that's because of the monster.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.152
- HUGO: What? A monster?

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.344
- AMICIA: Of course!

00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:47.221
The underground lakes are magical.

00:22:47.255 --> 00:22:50.034
Huge, ancient monsters hide in their depth.

00:22:50.057 --> 00:22:52.065
And watch out, they're very hungry.

00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:53.527
- HUGO: No, they're not.

00:22:53.595 --> 00:22:56.931
And if there were monsters,
we'd see some big bubbles.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.639
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS) You got me!

00:22:58.673 --> 00:23:02.166
- HUGO: Mummy used to say that:
<i>"Monsters are just those things...</i>

00:23:02.222 --> 00:23:03.505
"<i>...those things to...</i>

00:23:03.516 --> 00:23:06.608
- AMICIA: <i>...just those things to which
we have never given a name."</i>

00:23:06.675 --> 00:23:07.936
She told me that too.

00:23:07.992 --> 00:23:11.448
- HUGO: I would quite like to see a monster, actually.

00:23:17.925 --> 00:23:19.643
- AMICIA: Right, this is where we get off.

00:23:19.677 --> 00:23:21.686
- HUGO: Aw... It was too quick.

00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:25.039
- AMICIA: I know.
But it's someone else's turn now.

00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:34.302
- HUGO: There're no monsters here,
but there might be a whale.

00:23:34.358 --> 00:23:36.457
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES) A whale is big, you know.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.212
- HUGO: Yes, but... a little one?

00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:41.401
- AMICIA: Why not a shy whale
that doesn't want to show itself?

00:23:41.446 --> 00:23:45.345
- HUGO: It's shy because it's small.
But I'm sure it's pretty.

00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:53.080
- AMICIA: Over to you!
- LUCAS: We're coming!

00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:03.640
It's alright. You can let go.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.503
- MÉLIE: Wow...
- LUCAS: You alright?

00:24:05.597 --> 00:24:09.836
- MÉLIE: Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
don't like water much, that's all.

00:24:09.896 --> 00:24:13.589
- LUCAS: Mélie, listen...
I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:24:14.069 --> 00:24:19.548
I thought that Amicia and Hugo might die.
I-I was scared... I...

00:24:19.643 --> 00:24:22.830
- MÉLIE: For get it, it's all behind us now.

00:24:22.978 --> 00:24:26.097
However, anything that takes my fancy
at the castle is mine, alright?

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.392
- LUCAS: Fair enough.

00:24:37.361 --> 00:24:39.361
- AMICIA: (SCOFFS) Closed.
- MÉLIE: Not for long.

00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:40.721
Make some room.

00:24:43.939 --> 00:24:45.539
(LOCK PICKING NOISE)

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.150
It's done.

00:24:51.737 --> 00:24:52.737
Urgh...

00:24:52.763 --> 00:24:54.803
There you go. Of course.

00:24:55.803 --> 00:24:57.723
- AMICIA: What is this place, anyway?

00:24:57.764 --> 00:24:59.098
- LUCAS: It's...

00:24:59.593 --> 00:25:01.033
No, it can't be...

00:25:02.847 --> 00:25:05.154
Let us see this from closer up. That...

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.642
That pit...
- AMICIA: What, Lucas?

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:10.483
- HUGO: What's the matter?

00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:13.030
- LUCAS: That hanging brazier
can slide the length of the trench.

00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:13.921
- AMICIA: Lucas?

00:25:13.952 --> 00:25:16.780
- LUCAS: That one, the other way, it's a defence system.

00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:17.960
- HUGO: Like a castle?

00:25:18.007 --> 00:25:19.382
- LUCAS: Like a rat trap.

00:25:19.413 --> 00:25:20.827
Protecting something.

00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:22.929
- MÉLIE: And... How does it work?

00:25:22.952 --> 00:25:26.335
- LUCAS: Easy. The braziers push the rats towards the pit
and they get trapped there.

00:25:26.382 --> 00:25:27.593
- AMICIA: Could be useful.

00:25:27.624 --> 00:25:28.679
- HUGO: Who built it?

00:25:28.726 --> 00:25:31.429
- LUCAS: I don't know but it looks ancient.

00:25:31.468 --> 00:25:33.577
- HUGO: Come on, Lucas. Let's take a look.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.389
- AMICIA: Right, Mélie.
While the boys are daydreaming, we should get going.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.686
- LUCAS: Who built this?

00:25:38.718 --> 00:25:41.764
- HUGO: Some... uh...
Some knights, perhaps?

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.959
- LUCAS: I don't think knights
know how to use stone and mortar.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.540
But... craftsmen...

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:48.381
There're a lot of those.

00:25:48.449 --> 00:25:49.988
- HUGO: Lucas...

00:25:50.223 --> 00:25:52.968
It's just built a long time ago, but...

00:25:53.035 --> 00:25:54.966
The rats haven't been here for that long.

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:55.624
- LUCAS: You're right.

00:25:55.647 --> 00:25:58.638
- AMICIA: (EFFORT GRUNTS) Go on. Into the pit.
- LUCAS: That... gives me goosebumps.

00:25:58.694 --> 00:26:01.473
- AMICIA: We have to get to the other side.
- MÉLIE: Alright, come on.

00:26:04.687 --> 00:26:05.680
- AMICIA: Closed.

00:26:05.748 --> 00:26:08.214
Mélie, can you open this?
- MÉLIE: No.

00:26:08.426 --> 00:26:10.160
Maybe from the other side?

00:26:17.924 --> 00:26:19.352
- AMICIA: Come. I'll get you up.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.540
- MÉLIE: Yeah.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.138
(EFFORT GRUNTS)

00:26:46.384 --> 00:26:48.317
- HUGO: Lower the drawbridge!

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.360
- MÉLIE: Alright, I'll take care of the door.

00:26:55.926 --> 00:26:57.860
Come on.
Cross over, you two.

00:27:19.475 --> 00:27:21.409
This is a lot of bloody rats.

00:27:37.054 --> 00:27:40.278
- AMICIA: You can't fault their system. Very efficient!
- LUCAS: Perfect! Let's go!

00:27:52.377 --> 00:27:53.872
- AMICIA: I'll go first.

00:27:53.906 --> 00:27:55.106
- HUGO: Uh huh.

00:28:15.312 --> 00:28:17.778
- AMICIA: Another door (CHUCKLES)
Maybe it's the right one.

00:28:17.824 --> 00:28:21.024
- MÉLIE: I just hope...
There're no rats behind it.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.093
- AMICIA: Mélie, need a little help here.

00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:30.212
- MÉLIE: On my way. Come on...
I'm starting to get fed up of all these doors.

00:28:31.618 --> 00:28:34.352
- HUGO: Look! We've found it! The castle!

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:35.999
- MÉLIE: Wow...

00:28:36.328 --> 00:28:37.688
It really exists.

00:28:38.582 --> 00:28:40.602
- AMICIA: Château d'Ombrage.

00:28:41.038 --> 00:28:42.209
It's amazing.

00:28:42.478 --> 00:28:44.430
- LUCAS: I had a moment of doubt, but...

00:28:44.487 --> 00:28:45.487
That...

00:28:46.228 --> 00:28:48.906
That's the sort of alchemist's legend I like.

00:28:48.973 --> 00:28:51.240
Come on! Let's take a closer look!

00:28:56.663 --> 00:29:01.841
(RAINING &amp; THUNDERING NOISES)

00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:06.227
- MÉLIE: (SCOFFS) Rats!

00:29:06.429 --> 00:29:09.229
- AMICIA: I don't see uh...
I don't see how...

00:29:09.297 --> 00:29:11.430
- HUGO: Wow... Did you see that?

00:29:11.741 --> 00:29:15.379
- AMICIA: The lightning bolt.
They're afraid of lightning. Let's try it!

00:29:15.491 --> 00:29:17.758
- MÉLIE: (SCOFFS) Are you kidding?

00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:30.758
- AMICIA: Now! Run!

00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:32.461
- MÉLIE: This is crazy!

00:29:35.647 --> 00:29:38.047
- MÉLIE: (PANTING) Never... again...

00:29:38.672 --> 00:29:40.939
- LUCAS: A building? Unbelievable.

00:29:41.038 --> 00:29:42.366
People used to live here.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.761
- HUGO: We're very high up.

00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:45.650
- AMICIA: Don't worry, Hugo.

00:29:51.362 --> 00:29:54.888
- LUCAS: It's far away.
- AMICIA: Too far to get there in one go.

00:30:06.763 --> 00:30:08.697
This is it! Come on, come on!

00:30:10.346 --> 00:30:11.706
That should help.

00:30:12.868 --> 00:30:16.260
Come on! We're gonna make it!
- MÉLIE: Shit shit shit!

00:30:17.545 --> 00:30:20.234
- AMICIA: Come on, I'll help you!
- HUGO: Right.

00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:23.113
- MÉLIE: Is everyone alright?

00:30:23.147 --> 00:30:25.323
Did we make it? Really?

00:30:25.402 --> 00:30:27.410
- AMICIA: We did. We're here!

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.830
Look at it.

00:30:30.737 --> 00:30:33.191
- HUGO: Wow...
It's even bigger from here.

00:30:33.237 --> 00:30:35.370
- AMICIA: Let's get in. Come on!

00:30:42.042 --> 00:30:43.162
- HUGO: Wow...

00:30:43.292 --> 00:30:45.359
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)
Incredible.

00:30:52.979 --> 00:30:56.396
- LUCAS: That tower over there,
it's the living quarters.

00:30:56.451 --> 00:30:58.526
It must be several centuries old.

00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:00.178
- MÉLIE: It looks like it's dry.

00:31:00.223 --> 00:31:01.763
But there's a pit in the way.

00:31:01.819 --> 00:31:04.252
- HUGO: It's full of rats.
It's another trap.

00:31:04.386 --> 00:31:07.222
- LUCAS: There has to be another way to get through.

00:31:14.098 --> 00:31:15.458
- AMICIA: Locked.

00:31:16.103 --> 00:31:18.407
Can you take care of it?
- MÉLIE: Yes.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.660
This thing's...

00:31:19.905 --> 00:31:21.272
...really old.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.556
Oh... there was something alive in it.
It's opened.

00:31:33.707 --> 00:31:36.311
- AMICIA: They all decided to meet here, it seems.

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:40.569
- LUCAS: Look, a brazier.
Let's see if I can light it.

00:31:40.634 --> 00:31:42.431
- HUGO: So we can get the rats to move.

00:31:42.522 --> 00:31:46.220
- AMICIA: Lucas, Hugo, stay out of the rain.
We'll open up a path to the tower.

00:31:46.311 --> 00:31:48.245
- LUCAS: Alright.
Come, Hugo.

00:31:48.603 --> 00:31:49.540
- AMICIA: Ready, Mélie?

00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:52.105
- MÉLIE: As long as we get them out of the way.

00:31:57.874 --> 00:32:00.582
- AMICIA: Come on. The Siege of Château d'Ombrage -

00:32:00.647 --> 00:32:05.321
- two girls versus thousands of rats.
This battle will go down in history.

00:32:06.975 --> 00:32:08.975
- MÉLIE: Look, they're moving.

00:32:18.616 --> 00:32:21.129
We should be able to reach the central section now.

00:32:21.194 --> 00:32:22.951
- AMICIA: Yes, that's a good first step.

00:32:23.017 --> 00:32:25.269
- MÉLIE: I'll let you go first, 'cause...

00:32:25.491 --> 00:32:26.780
Rats are your thing.

00:32:26.832 --> 00:32:29.099
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES) Thanks a lot.

00:32:36.064 --> 00:32:44.136
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:32:44.306 --> 00:32:45.881
- MÉLIE: Go on! I'm with you!

00:32:45.986 --> 00:32:48.586
- AMICIA: Great! I feel better already!

00:32:55.074 --> 00:32:57.541
I'm going to need Mélie to push that.

00:33:04.046 --> 00:33:05.269
Hey, look at that!

00:33:05.296 --> 00:33:06.296
- HUGO: Oh!

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:19.475
- MÉLIE: Well... I guess that's what the pit for.

00:33:21.442 --> 00:33:24.683
- AMICIA: (SCOFFS) The brazier's coming back by itself.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.650
Mélie, can you get to me?

00:33:27.054 --> 00:33:30.113
- MÉLIE: I'm coming.
Can't wait to get up there.

00:33:33.264 --> 00:33:34.304
Look at them.

00:33:34.514 --> 00:33:37.248
Swarming like nobles at the king's court.

00:33:37.275 --> 00:33:39.275
- AMICIA: But it's <i>our</i> castle.

00:33:45.296 --> 00:33:48.688
Right. Those ones have to be driven into the pit too.

00:33:49.072 --> 00:33:52.274
And of course, they're on the wrong side of the brazier.

00:33:52.392 --> 00:33:55.295
I'm gonna have to go down and see what's there.
- MÉLIE: Alright.

00:33:55.322 --> 00:33:57.455
I'll cover you with the brazier.

00:33:59.332 --> 00:34:01.363
- AMICIA: I'm putting my life on your hands, you know.

00:34:01.455 --> 00:34:04.605
- MÉLIE: All in a day's work, my lady.
Whenever you're ready.

00:34:15.296 --> 00:34:17.965
- AMICIA: Think you can do this?
- MÉLIE: Understood.

00:34:18.278 --> 00:34:19.278
Wow...

00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:22.626
It could do with... a bit of grease.

00:34:23.043 --> 00:34:24.475
- AMICIA: Would you rather be down here?

00:34:24.554 --> 00:34:27.834
- MÉLIE: I'm fine. I'm just... warming up.

00:34:29.762 --> 00:34:32.457
I'm at the end.
What do you see?

00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:33.733
- AMICIA: More braziers.

00:34:33.811 --> 00:34:35.678
I can get up on the rampart.

00:34:35.712 --> 00:34:37.312
- MÉLIE: Go on then.

00:34:38.863 --> 00:34:41.155
- AMICIA: We're going to make it.
Hugo will be safe.

00:34:41.194 --> 00:34:42.634
We'll all be safe.

00:34:56.259 --> 00:34:59.631
Mélie, I'm clearing the outer area.
They're coming your way.

00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:02.014
- MÉLIE: Alright. There are so many of them.

00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:04.006
We'll never clear a path that way!

00:35:04.124 --> 00:35:06.311
- AMICIA: Right. We need to clear the whole courtyard.

00:35:06.403 --> 00:35:08.017
- MÉLIE: Let's get on with it then.

00:35:08.095 --> 00:35:09.829
I'm already soaked anyway.

00:35:36.494 --> 00:35:39.188
There you go! Into the pit, would you?

00:35:39.332 --> 00:35:41.012
- AMICIA: Yes!
Perfect!

00:35:42.692 --> 00:35:46.610
Well, that's done. The last sector now.
I have to get back to the ladder.

00:35:53.642 --> 00:35:55.491
Alright, here we go again!

00:35:55.556 --> 00:35:57.470
- LUCAS: Have you done it?
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:35:57.522 --> 00:35:58.837
Are you alright, Hugo?

00:35:58.916 --> 00:36:01.389
- HUGO: I'm fine!
But they'll hear you shouting!

00:36:01.507 --> 00:36:04.032
- AMICIA: Don't worry.
The storm will drown out our voices.

00:36:04.137 --> 00:36:06.181
Soon, we'll all get to see the tower.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.287
- HUGO: Yes!
- LUCAS: Good luck!

00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:37.958
- MÉLIE: That's a bit better.

00:36:46.936 --> 00:36:48.376
Whenever you want.

00:36:54.749 --> 00:36:56.949
The bridge...
we better lower it.

00:36:58.421 --> 00:36:59.787
- AMICIA: And so...

00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:01.278
<i>Amicia the Amazon</i>

00:37:01.754 --> 00:37:03.434
and <i>Mélie the Stealthy</i>

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.196
...conquered the Château d'Ombrage!
- MÉLIE: (CHUCKLES)

00:37:07.509 --> 00:37:10.191
You've read too many books.
- AMICIA: I...

00:37:10.712 --> 00:37:13.980
- MÉLIE: Come on.
We still have to clean up the area down there.

00:37:14.137 --> 00:37:16.493
We're going to need the brazier from the rampart.

00:37:16.584 --> 00:37:17.847
I'll cover you with this one.

00:37:17.887 --> 00:37:19.436
- AMICIA: Alright. I'm going down.

00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:20.217
- MÉLIE: Oh...

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.649
- AMICIA: (ANXIOUS) What is it?

00:37:21.676 --> 00:37:25.004
- MÉLIE: Nothing. It's just the crappy old lever.

00:37:25.074 --> 00:37:27.535
- AMICIA: Mélie, you always know the right thing to say.

00:37:27.561 --> 00:37:29.201
- MÉLIE: It's going to be alright.

00:37:29.267 --> 00:37:32.248
It's your castle.
You have uh... <i>connection</i>.

00:37:32.353 --> 00:37:33.941
- AMICIA: <i>Our</i> castle!

00:37:33.968 --> 00:37:36.634
Imagine we could all live here together!

00:37:36.714 --> 00:37:39.683
- MÉLIE: (CHUCKLES) I'm more of a cellar girl, you know.

00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:41.571
- AMICIA: How am I going to get up there?

00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:42.574
- MÉLIE: (INAUDIBLE)

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.644
- AMICIA: But the damn rats are everywhere!

- AMICIA: Oh... very funny!

00:38:50.009 --> 00:38:54.397
- MÉLIE: (SCOFFS) That brought chaos over here!
I'm going to need you.

00:38:54.462 --> 00:38:55.634
- AMICIA: I'm coming!

00:38:55.699 --> 00:38:58.033
- MÉLIE: Alright. Here we go again!

00:38:58.082 --> 00:38:59.853
- AMICIA: This is how you conquer a castle!

00:38:59.905 --> 00:39:01.623
- MÉLIE: This is how you get sick!

00:39:01.663 --> 00:39:04.563
- AMICIA: No! Not in my version of the story!

00:39:14.554 --> 00:39:17.326
- MÉLIE: Come on!
Come on, we're almost <i>fucking</i> there!

00:39:17.405 --> 00:39:23.590
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS) And with these noble words
they readied themself to recover what was rightfully theirs.

00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:24.655
A home!

00:39:24.879 --> 00:39:26.037
- MÉLIE: Stop it!

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.110
- AMICIA: Come on!
I'm sure there's a cellar for you here, somewhere.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.683
- MÉLIE: Amicia, it's not that simple!

00:39:32.014 --> 00:39:34.414
You don't know me.
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:39:34.462 --> 00:39:35.647
I understand.

00:39:47.587 --> 00:39:50.790
- MÉLIE: (YELLING) NOW NOW NOW! LOSE THE DRAGON!!

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:54.123
(COUGHS) Come on, back off you bastards!

Retreat before <i>Amicia the Amazon</i> and <i>Mélie the Fury</i>!

00:39:58.212 --> 00:39:59.412

Launretius was right.

- MÉLIE: To celebrate our victory,
would you mind if we get out of the rain, please?

00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:32.139
- AMICIA: Right. To the tower!

00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:40.175
