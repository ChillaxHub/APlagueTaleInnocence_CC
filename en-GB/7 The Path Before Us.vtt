00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:44.160
- MÉLIE: Right now, we have to hide.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.933
Arthur and I know a place.

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:48.359
- AMICIA: And Lucas?

00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:51.875
- MÉLIE: He's waiting at your château.
All in good time.

00:00:51.973 --> 00:00:54.492
- HUGO: We're going to see Lucas again?
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)

00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:58.945
I hope so.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.312

Let's keep moving. We're not safe yet.

00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:16.973
Would you mind moving on?

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:20.949
Tell me...

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.948
What the hell are you doing
with The Inquisition after you?

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:26.011
What's so special about the little guy?

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:28.605
- AMICIA: It's... complicated.

00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:31.246
And what about your brother?
Will he be alright?

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.527
- MÉLIE: He'll catch up with us.

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:35.558

- MÉLIE: Hey...

00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:38.333
Don't get all lovey dovey.

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:40.511
He'll break your poor little heart.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.152
- AMICIA: I... I-I... No.

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.168
- HUGO: Hey, a mill!

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.761
- MÉLIE: Yeah, we're going to use it to cross.

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:49.991
- HUGO: Wow...

00:01:55.793 --> 00:01:57.473
Oh, what are those birds?

00:01:57.746 --> 00:01:59.026
- AMICIA: Ducks.

00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:00.333
- HUGO: Oh...

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:02.317
Like... the ones we eat?

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:03.558
- AMICIA: Yes...

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:05.980
And they eat frogs. That's live.

- MÉLIE: I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:11.090

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.411
- MÉLIE: Is he always...

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:24.833
...like that?

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:27.090
- AMICIA: He hasn't seen much of the world.

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:30.084
- MÉLIE: This isn't the best moment to start.

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:34.158
- HUGO: First one to mill wins.
- AMICIA: Hey, slow down!

00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:36.730
- HUGO: It's closed.

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:38.393
- MÉLIE: I'll do it.

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:44.918
It's opened.

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:06.761
- HUGO: Oh, a big wheel!

00:03:06.824 --> 00:03:09.358
- AMICIA: It's for crushing the wheat.

00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:22.386
- MÉLIE: (SIGHS) The current is too strong.

00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.511
- HUGO: How are we going to get across?

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.855
- MÉLIE: By stopping it.
- HUGO: And how are we going to stop it?

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:31.334
- MÉLIE: Amicia...
- AMICIA: We'll find a way.

00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:36.933

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:42.199
(CRANKING)

00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:44.933

00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:52.418
- AMICIA: It's working!
- HUGO: Yay!

00:03:52.528 --> 00:03:54.527
- MÉLIE: All we have to do now is cross over.

00:03:54.574 --> 00:03:57.418
- HUGO: Amicia, you're not leaving without me, are you?

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.027
- AMICIA: I'm coming, Hugo.
I'm just trying to find a way to get you across.

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.921
- MÉLIE: (CHUCKLES) You sound like Arthur.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.766

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.173

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.355
- AMICIA: And there you go! See! Simple.

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:42.870
- MÉLIE: If The Inquisition make it this far,
that'll hold them up for a while.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.143
- AMICIA: (EFFORT GRUNT)

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:56.167

00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:57.916
...through here.

00:04:58.167 --> 00:04:59.167
Come on.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.823
- MÉLIE: Are you trying to impress me or what?

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:02.588
- AMICIA: No.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.557
- MÉLIE: Alright, come on.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.820
- HUGO: It's pretty here.
And it smells like earth.

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:10.729
The <i>ah-kee-duct</i>, is that where Lucas is?

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:11.604
- AMICIA: I hope so.

00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.151
- MÉLIE: I doubt this castle is going to look like much.

00:05:14.198 --> 00:05:14.854
- AMICIA: Why?

00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:16.667
- MÉLIE: This used to be a village.

00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:20.276
But it was reduced to rubble
in just one night, years ago.

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.729
Some says that there's a curse around these parts.

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:23.885
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.401
- AMICIA: She's joking, Hugo.

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:26.901
- MÉLIE: Of course, I am.

00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:29.517
Since when do I say anything true, eh?

Hugo, look at me.

00:05:53.413 --> 00:05:56.069
Is it starting again, your head?

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:06.798
MÉLIE: Don't say he's been bitten.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.298
- AMICIA: It's not The Bite.
It's something in his blood since he was little.

00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:12.594
I'll have to carry him.

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.073
Climb on my back if you can.
Come on.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.360

- MÉLIE: If it's in his blood...

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.955
What about you?
- AMICIA: I'm fine.

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:28.376
Lucas is trying to slow the effect down.

00:06:28.408 --> 00:06:30.875
That's also why we go to the château.

00:06:31.752 --> 00:06:33.112
- HUGO: Amicia...

00:06:33.924 --> 00:06:34.924
I'm scared.

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:36.158
- AMICIA: Of what, Hugo?

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:37.595
- HUGO: What's in my head.

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:40.892
- MÉLIE: Don't worry.
We're all scared of what's in our heads.

00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:41.955
Here we are.

00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:43.885
You'll be able to rest.

- HUGO: Oh...

00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:09.251
Is this your house?
- MÉLIE: It's a hideout, lad.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.151
It's meant for hiding out not banquets with Lords and Ladies.

00:07:13.643 --> 00:07:15.003
Don't touch that!

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.440
It's my brother's

00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:18.286
That's worth a lot, that is.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:22.345
- AMICIA: How long have you been living like this?

00:07:22.393 --> 00:07:24.861
- MÉLIE: Like ruffians and beggars, you mean?

00:07:24.893 --> 00:07:26.253
Family tradition.

00:07:26.643 --> 00:07:28.486
Our dad was a piece of rubbish.

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.470
Tried to beat us one time too many so we skidaddled.

00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:33.689
But you... You're almost royalty.

00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:35.986
- AMICIA: Royalty? Huh.
- HUGO: Amicia.

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:37.658

- HUGO: I'm cold.

00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:43.203
- AMICIA: Can't you see? Look at us.
We've lost everything.

00:07:43.235 --> 00:07:45.859
- MÉLIE: What'd you mean?
Who's going to pay us then?

00:07:45.907 --> 00:07:47.594
- AMICIA: What're you talking about?

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:51.312

What'd you reckon?
- LUCAS: You're right. Let's just go.

00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:26.119
Let's keep going.

00:17:26.175 --> 00:17:27.782
The château shouldn't be far now.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.308
- MÉLIE: Let's go. Come on.
It's not far to the aqueduct.

00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:35.058
- LUCAS: Seems like you've been through
some tough times.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.708
- MÉLIE: (SCOFFS) You don't say.
You forgot to tell  us about the Inquisition.

00:17:38.764 --> 00:17:40.527
- LUCAS: You wouldn't have accepted the deal.

00:17:40.628 --> 00:17:42.224
- MÉLIE: The one where your friends are rich?

00:17:42.414 --> 00:17:43.775
- LUCAS: We'll sort it out.

00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:45.831
- MÉLIE: Tell my brother that.

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:51.275
(RANING SOUND)
(CHILLING MUSIC PLAYING)

00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:54.277
What's all this?
- LUCAS: An accident?

00:17:59.188 --> 00:18:01.509
- AMICIA: An Inquisition cart.
- LUCAS: Rats...

00:18:01.554 --> 00:18:04.478
- MÉLIE: There must be things
we can salvage from inside.

00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:06.587
- AMICIA: I don't see how we can get past.

00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:07.860
- LUCAS: Oh, Amicia!

00:18:07.938 --> 00:18:09.618
I have something for you.

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:13.195
It's a by-product of Ignifer — Luminosa.

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:16.242
You throw it in a pile of rats and...

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:17.793
Anyway, you'll see it...

00:18:17.894 --> 00:18:19.014
Here, take it.

00:18:20.405 --> 00:18:22.538
Saltpatre, alcohol, and leather.

00:18:22.827 --> 00:18:24.267
Mix them together.

00:18:24.534 --> 00:18:25.829
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.896
- LUCAS: Throw it to the rats.

00:18:30.907 --> 00:18:31.822
Boom!

00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:32.878
Luminosa!

00:18:32.927 --> 00:18:34.612
- HUGO: Ah... My eyes sting.

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:37.815
- MÉLIE: (CHUCKLES) It completely destroyed them.

00:18:45.673 --> 00:18:48.864
- AMICIA: Lucas, the cart is packed
full of alchemical materials.

00:18:48.887 --> 00:18:50.487
- LUCAS: Make sense.

00:18:50.751 --> 00:18:51.933
The Inquisition...

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:56.283
They couldn't have got as far as the Macula
without reading the alchemical writings.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.483
I don't know what they're up to.

00:18:58.582 --> 00:19:01.908
But whatever it is, these carts will be useful.

00:19:02.031 --> 00:19:04.329
- HUGO: The <i>ah-kee-duct</i>! We're nearly there!

00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:05.546
- LUCAS: Finally...

00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:07.736
We're going to find out at last.

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:14.284
- AMICIA: I'll help you up.
- HUGO: Alright.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.245
Let's go up the <i>ah-kee-duct</i>!

00:19:20.301 --> 00:19:22.153
- AMICIA: Hugo, it's <i>a-kwuh-duct</i>

00:19:22.187 --> 00:19:23.187
- HUGO: Oh.

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:25.323
<i>Ah-Kwuh-Duct</i>

00:19:25.803 --> 00:19:26.803
Aqueduct!

00:19:29.508 --> 00:19:31.628
- LUCAS: Mélie, where're your brother?

00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.503
- MÉLIE: I don't want to talk about it.

00:19:33.593 --> 00:19:34.564
- LUCAS: Er...

00:19:34.587 --> 00:19:35.587
Al-Alright.

00:19:47.388 --> 00:19:48.508
- HUGO: Wow...

00:19:48.738 --> 00:19:50.418
- MÉLIE: Well spotted.

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:56.259
- AMICIA: Come on. Get up there.
- HUGO: Yes.

00:20:02.857 --> 00:20:04.057
- AMICIA: What?

00:20:04.553 --> 00:20:05.553
Is that it?

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:08.392
There's nothing here. Lucas, I...

00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:11.695
Don't tell me we've done all this for nothing.

00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:13.314
- LUCAS: No! No, no.

00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:15.747
Laurentius was smarter than that.

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:18.191
It was alchemist's trick.

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:21.372
<i>"Gold is born from lead...</i>

00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:25.935
<i>The door shall only reveal itself
to the one who has the key."</i>

00:20:26.093 --> 00:20:27.399
Something like that.

00:20:27.444 --> 00:20:29.541
- MÉLIE: Hm... I prefer...

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.934
<i>"Use your eyes, before using your mouth."</i>

00:20:34.352 --> 00:20:35.736
Who's going first?

00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:37.221
- LUCAS: Nice one.

00:20:37.265 --> 00:20:38.305
Uh... Amicia?

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:41.070
- AMICIA: Come on, then.
We've come this far.

00:20:41.104 --> 00:20:42.784
- MÉLIE: That's my girl!

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:49.639
- HUGO: Oh, wow!

00:20:52.332 --> 00:20:54.162
- AMICIA: Oh!
- MÉLIE: (WHISTLES)

00:20:54.475 --> 00:20:55.475
Not bad.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.514
- HUGO: Is that... the sea?

00:20:57.544 --> 00:21:00.300
- LUCAS: No, it's water that's collected underground.

00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:02.026
Hey, there's a pontoon.

00:21:02.723 --> 00:21:06.695
- AMICIA: People used to use this place.
We're on the right track!

00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:19.296
- MÉLIE: I've... never heard of it before.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.524
- HUGO: And the château?

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:21.450
Where is it?

00:21:21.495 --> 00:21:25.870
- LUCAS: Well, if you want to know,
we have to get across first.

00:21:27.946 --> 00:21:28.946
Well done!

00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:43.905
A reaction ferry.

00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:44.586
- AMICIA: A what?

00:21:44.631 --> 00:21:47.577
- LUCAS: A boat that's propelled
by a rope, you pull it by hand.

00:21:47.846 --> 00:21:49.846
- MÉLIE: There's a hand crank.

00:21:57.678 --> 00:21:59.745
- AMICIA: Can you do it, Mélie?

00:22:00.189 --> 00:22:03.481
- MÉLIE: Lucas! Come and help instead of sleeping.

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:04.954
- LUCAS: Er... Yes, yes.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.495
- HUGO: The water is green.

00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:08.972
- LUCAS: That's because there're lots of things living in it.

00:22:09.017 --> 00:22:10.434
- HUGO: They must be very cold.

00:22:10.502 --> 00:22:13.459
- AMICIA: Once, Father took us to the lake at Tourves.

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:15.780
And I slipped, and fell in the water.

00:22:15.825 --> 00:22:17.959
It was so cold that made me cry.

00:22:18.013 --> 00:22:20.724
- HUGO: (LAUGHS) I would've cried too.

00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.966
- MÉLIE: Your boat awaits.

00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:26.707
- HUGO: Shall I get in?
- AMICIA: Yes, Hugo, get in.

00:22:26.742 --> 00:22:28.742
- MÉLIE: I hope they can swim.

00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:34.101
Hold on tight.

00:22:34.164 --> 00:22:35.204
There you go!

00:22:35.592 --> 00:22:36.592
- HUGO: Wow!

00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:40.882
I can't see any fish.

00:22:40.972 --> 00:22:42.735
- AMICIA: Oh... that's because of the monster.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.152
- HUGO: What? A monster?

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.344
- AMICIA: Of course!

00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:47.221
The underground lakes are magical.

00:22:47.255 --> 00:22:50.034
Huge, ancient monsters hide in their depth.

00:22:50.057 --> 00:22:52.065
And watch out, they're very hungry.

00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:53.527
- HUGO: No, they're not.

00:22:53.595 --> 00:22:56.931
And if there were monsters,
we'd see some big bubbles.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.639
- AMICIA: (LAUGHS) You got me!

00:22:58.673 --> 00:23:02.166
- HUGO: Mummy used to say that:
<i>"Monsters are just those things...</i>

00:23:02.222 --> 00:23:03.505
"<i>...those things to...</i>

00:23:03.516 --> 00:23:06.608
- AMICIA: <i>...just those things to which
we have never given a name."</i>

00:23:06.675 --> 00:23:07.936
She told me that too.

00:23:07.992 --> 00:23:11.448
- HUGO: I would quite like to see a monster, actually.

00:23:17.925 --> 00:23:19.643
- AMICIA: Right, this is where we get off.

00:23:19.677 --> 00:23:21.686
- HUGO: Aw... It was too quick.

00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:25.039
- AMICIA: I know.
But it's someone else's turn now.
