00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.193
- AMICIA: Shhh...

00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:58.034
Lucas?

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:01.975
- LUCAS: Yes?

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.868
- AMICIA: What does he have...

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:06.107
...in his blood?

00:01:06.972 --> 00:01:09.305
- LUCAS: There's... an old story...

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.308
It tells of the Prima Macula.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.257
The alchemists say it was the first corruption.

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:17.402
and that it silently travels
in the blood of certain families.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.628
But... something happened.

00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:21.425
<i>The Great Break</i>.

00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:23.515
And the Macula awoke...

00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:25.742
...in Hugo's blood.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.062
- AMICIA: But... What will it do to him?

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.777
- LUCAS: The Macula cares
for neither good nor evil.

00:01:31.836 --> 00:01:33.886
It evolves with its host.

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:35.605
To change things.

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.050
The world.

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:40.800
You know, your Mother and Laurentius
were trying to help your brother.

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:42.647
- AMICIA: But they failed.

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:44.408
- LUCAS: No.

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.095
I think they just... ran out of time.

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:49.403
This is it.

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:08.284
We'll walk from here.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:09.435
It'll warm you up.

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:10.888
- LUCAS: If you follow the aqueduct...

00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:13.738
We should arrive at Château d'Ombrage
before nightfall.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.941
- HUGO: What's that noise?

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.982
- AMICIA: Nothing.

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:17.527
It's just frogs, Hugo.

There are so many!

00:02:29.906 --> 00:02:31.640
Look! There're everywhere!

00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:34.964
Jump! Jump! Jump!

00:02:37.662 --> 00:02:38.862

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.289
- LUCAS: A little. Yes.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.105
- AMICIA: Hugo doesn't seem to mind.

00:02:44.175 --> 00:02:46.344
- LUCAS: (CHUCKLE) He's keeping himself warm.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.653
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:02:47.897 --> 00:02:50.031

- AMICIA: An English shield?

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.784
Where did you find that?

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:41.610
- HUGO: Over there.
Lying on the ground.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.264
- AMICIA: Listen, Hugo...

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.796
Put that down.

We don't have a choice.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:53.718

00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:56.583
Come on.

00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:08.516
