00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:28.004
Hugo: Amicia, so we'll never be able to go back home?

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.869
Amicia: No.

00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:30.837
It's too dangerous.

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:32.758
Hugo: Are there rats there too?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.790
Amicia: Maybe.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:35.904
I... I don't know, Hugo.

00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:36.910
Hugo: I'm scared.

00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:39.338
They'll find us when it gets dark.

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:42.180
Amicia: We'll be safe with Laurentius. Come on.

00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:02.175
Up there. A windmill.

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:04.540
Hugo: Is that Laurentius' farm?

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:06.175
Amicia: I hope so.

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.619
Hugo: I've never seen a real windmill.

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:11.238
Amicia: If we're careful, you'll be seeing one very soon.

00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:25.835
Hey! Hugo, where are you going?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.609
Hugo: Oh! Bubbles! Look at the bubbles!

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.378
Amicia: Yes, Hugo.

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:35.584
Hugo: What is it?

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.489
Amicia: It could be a fish, a frog, I really don't know.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.060
We don't have time for this right now. Come on.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:44.381
Hugo: But I've never seen a real frog.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:02:03.661
(RIVER FLOWING)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.942
Someone came here to read a book.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.799
Amicia: Blood.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.323
- Hugo: What happened?
- Amicia: I don't know

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:25.736
But it didn't end well.

00:02:25.943 --> 00:02:26.799
Hugo: Perhaps...

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.746
... Perhaps there were rats.

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:40.697
Amicia.

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:41.475
Look!

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:44.189
It's one of the men that attacked the house.

00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:45.443
Amicia: The Inquisition.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.071
They're here.

00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:02.184
Soldier 2: Do I look like a rat?

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.374
How should I know?

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:08.168
Soldier 2: Whatever happens...

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.638
We have to get out of here before the sun goes down.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.177
They like the dark.

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:15.015
So back to business.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.796
Soldier 1: That's an odd sound.

00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:44.096
Nah... Nothing.

00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:45.682
Nothing here.

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:01.682
Hugo: Amicia, look!

00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:04.479
There's a bridge that leads to the farm.

00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:09.394
Soldier 3: What a waste of time!

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:13.766
The Grand Inquisitor should just tell us what he really wants from us.

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:28.122
What was it?

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.401
Soldier 4: That should do it.

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:38.592
With that and the second barricade. No one will ever get through.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:39.953
Soldier 5: I'm going to the bridge.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.319
The cart will be back with the other barricade.

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:45.586
Amicia: (whispering) We're trapped!

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.946
Hugo: (whispering) There's a hole in the wall.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.628
Amicia: (whispering) I'm too big.

00:04:49.828 --> 00:04:52.526
You'll have to go in and open the window for me.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.733
Hugo: (whispering) But they'll see me.

00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:56.314
Amicia: (whispering) I'll keep them busy. Trust me.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.740
Soldier 6: That noise...

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.903
Better go see what it was.

00:05:08.357 --> 00:05:10.757
- Amicia: Come on.
- Hugo: I'm going.

00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:21.821
Soldier 6: Nah. Nothing to report.

00:05:22.974 --> 00:05:24.974
Amicia: Yes. Now it's my turn.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.797
Soldier 6: I've got to know for sure.

00:05:46.487 --> 00:05:49.482
- Amicia: Well done!
- Hugo: Amicia, we have to get out of here.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.751
Soldier 7: Still nothing.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.780
(CART WITH HORSE SOUNDS)

00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:18.981
Amicia: Oh no! They've blocked ... the farm.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.029
Soldier 8: Tell Lord Nicholas that the road is blocked.

00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:26.161
Soldier 9: And what are we looking for exactly?

00:06:26.273 --> 00:06:27.431
Soldier 8: A five-year-old kid.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:28.836
Hugo de Rune.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.161
Brown hair, blue eyes.

00:06:30.352 --> 00:06:32.485
Hugo: Are they talking about me? Why me?

00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:34.824
Amicia: Shh... Not now.

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.931
Soldier 8: ...Very important, I was told.

00:06:39.218 --> 00:06:42.408
Lord Nicholas has his orders direct from the Grand Inquisitor and self.

00:06:42.678 --> 00:06:44.358
So keep your eyes peeled.

00:07:06.983 --> 00:07:08.871
Hugo: Careful! There's a guard in there.

00:07:09.332 --> 00:07:10.332
Amicia: Yes.

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:21.669
Soldier 10: Where was that noise coming from? Over there!

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:28.642
- Amicia: Careful how you land.
- Hugo: Yes.

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:37.898
Amicia.

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.065
Amicia: What?

00:08:39.902 --> 00:08:42.314
Hugo: What did I do? Why are they looking for me?

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:43.942
Amicia: You didn't do anything.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.751
It's...

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:47.403
They're the ones who did something.

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:51.109
Hugo: If they catch us, will they hurt us?

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:54.340
Amicia: They're not going to catch us, alright?

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:55.588
Hugo: Alright.

00:09:05.585 --> 00:09:06.625
Amicia: Hugo?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760
Hugo.

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.035
Where are you?

00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.535
Ah... Hugo, it's not funny.

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:34.258
Hugo.
- Hugo: (surprises) Oh, you've found me. (laughters)

00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:37.934
Amicia: Did you really think this is the time to be playing games?
- Hugo: But...

00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:39.759
Amicia: Do you want they guards to catch you?

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.118
Don't do that again!

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.420
Hugo: Sorry.

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:47.266
Amicia: (whispering) They're here.

00:09:49.072 --> 00:09:51.338
Hugo: Hey, piggy. You should hide.

00:09:51.564 --> 00:09:52.764
It's dangerous.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.338
Oh... They're everywhere.

00:10:51.878 --> 00:10:53.132
Soldier 1: I did...

00:10:53.354 --> 00:10:55.488
 I did hear something overthere.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.875
Soldier 2: Well, that sound...

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:20.167
Came from over there, didn't it?

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.650
I...uh...

00:11:35.967 --> 00:11:36.967
No.

00:11:37.174 --> 00:11:38.854
There's nothing there.

00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:25.899
Soldier ?: That noise...

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.271
I think it came from over there.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.388
Soldier ?: What was that?

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:48.690
Hugo: So they can't see us anymore.

00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:50.716
Amicia: No, they can't.

Amicia: Fall back? What's happening?

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:16.419
Hugo...
(HIGH PITCH NOISE)

00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:18.131
We can't stop. Not here.

00:14:19.324 --> 00:14:21.004
Hugo: I feel... funny.

00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:21.974
Amicia: Come on.

00:14:22.101 --> 00:14:24.968
You'll be able to rest when we get to Laurentius' place.

00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:26.916
Hugo: Ah... my head...

00:14:27.268 --> 00:14:28.268
It hurts...

00:14:30.278 --> 00:14:32.389
Amicia: I don't know what to do, Hugo.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.690
What would Mummy do?

00:14:33.754 --> 00:14:35.039
Hugo: Give me my listen.

00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:36.690
Amicia: I can carry you.

00:14:36.738 --> 00:14:38.418
That's the best I can do.

00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:40.131
Come on. Climb up.

00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:54.829
Hugo: Mummy says I shouldn't leave the house, you know.

00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:56.913
Amicia: I know.

00:14:57.025 --> 00:14:59.611
Hugo: That must be why I feel all funny.

00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:02.838
Amicia: You're just tired.

00:15:04.247 --> 00:15:05.607
Hugo: I miss her.

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:08.646
Amicia: At least you were allowed to see her.

00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:09.789
Hugo: Huh?

00:15:10.481 --> 00:15:11.761
Amicia: Nothing.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:26.006
Laurentius' mill. We're nearly there.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.657
Hugo: Will he shut me inside again? Like Mummy.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.796
- Amicia: He'll get us to safety.
- Hugo: Alright.

00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:35.575
It's true that it's dangerous out there.

00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:37.083
But...

00:15:36.797 --> 00:15:39.030
Sometimes, it's fun, too.

Amicia: You'll get better one day.

Hugo: Are those dead animals?

00:15:44.776 --> 00:15:47.077
Amicia: What on earth happened here?

00:15:47.172 --> 00:15:51.332
We're going to have to be careful now. You better get down, Hugo.

00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:18.609
We have to get in somehow.

00:20:24.046 --> 00:20:26.113
Hugo: Oh... You're still alive.

00:20:26.474 --> 00:20:28.408
I'm sorry about your friends.

00:20:41.242 --> 00:20:42.067
Amicia: Hugo...

00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:44.480
You go in there and open the door for me quickly.

00:20:44.782 --> 00:20:46.382
And be very careful, alright?

00:20:46.782 --> 00:20:47.782
Hugo: Yes.

00:20:49.317 --> 00:20:50.357
Amicia: Good.

00:20:54.773 --> 00:20:56.630
Hugo: Ughh... It smells funny.

00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:58.900
Amicia: It's alcohol. From the stills.

00:21:01.054 --> 00:21:02.334
(COUGHING SOUND)

00:21:02.953 --> 00:21:04.127
Hugo: There's someone there.

00:21:04.525 --> 00:21:05.950
Amicia: Let's go and see.

00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:15.014
(COUGHING SOUND)

00:21:29.585 --> 00:21:30.394
Boy: Who are you?

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:31.759
Amicia: Magister Laurentius!

00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:34.439
Boy: Stop right there. He's contagious.

00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:36.598
Laurentius: Hugo...

00:21:37.024 --> 00:21:37.580
...here?

00:21:37.738 --> 00:21:39.595
Amicia: The Inquisition came...

00:21:39.707 --> 00:21:41.072
We've lost everything.

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:43.199
There was nothing I could do... I...

00:21:43.913 --> 00:21:45.593
Laurentius: Of course.

00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:48.574
They... came for him.

00:21:50.503 --> 00:21:51.241
An...

00:21:51.265 --> 00:21:52.614
An evil...

00:21:54.757 --> 00:21:56.487
Ancient evil.

00:22:00.483 --> 00:22:01.991
In his blood.

00:22:03.923 --> 00:22:05.043
Your Mother...

00:22:05.177 --> 00:22:06.177
...and I...

00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:08.970
...attempted to slow its progress.

00:22:10.003 --> 00:22:11.003
But...

00:22:11.067 --> 00:22:13.201
...ever since The Great Break...

00:22:14.691 --> 00:22:16.373
...the process has...

00:22:16.516 --> 00:22:17.636
...quickened.

00:22:20.034 --> 00:22:21.034
You must...

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.750
...protect him, Amicia.

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:27.968
Continue your Mother's work.

00:22:27.524 --> 00:22:28.301
- Amicia: Me?

00:22:28.461 --> 00:22:29.461
But how?

00:22:29.874 --> 00:22:32.129
My parents tried and now they're both dead.

00:22:32.241 --> 00:22:33.441
Leave me alone!

00:22:34.066 --> 00:22:36.621
(GROUND SHAKING AND BREAKING)

00:22:37.177 --> 00:22:38.617
Boy: They're here.
