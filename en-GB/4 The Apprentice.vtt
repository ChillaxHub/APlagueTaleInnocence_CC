IV - THE APPRENTICE

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:28.004
- HUGO: Amicia, so we'll never be able to go back home?

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.869
- AMICIA: No.

00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:30.837
It's too dangerous.

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:32.758
- HUGO: Are there rats there too?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.790
- AMICIA: Maybe.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:35.904
I... I don't know, Hugo.

00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:36.910
- HUGO: I'm scared.

00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:39.338
They'll find us when it gets dark.

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:42.180
- AMICIA: We'll be safe with Laurentius. Come on.

00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:02.175
Up there. A windmill.

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:04.540
- HUGO: Is that Laurentius' farm?

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:06.175
- AMICIA: I hope so.

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.619
- HUGO: I've never seen a real windmill.

00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:11.238
- AMICIA: If we're careful, you'll be seeing one very soon.

00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:25.835
Hey! Hugo, where are you going?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.609
- HUGO: Oh! Bubbles! Look at the bubbles!

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.378
- AMICIA: Yes, Hugo.

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:35.584
- HUGO: What is it?

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.489
- AMICIA: It could be a fish, a frog, I really don't know.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.060
We don't have time for this right now. Come on.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:44.381
- HUGO: But I've never seen a real frog.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:02:03.661
(RIVER FLOWING)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.942
Someone came here to read a book.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.799
- AMICIA: Blood.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.323
- HUGO: What happened?
- AMICIA: I don't know

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:25.736
But it didn't end well.

00:02:25.943 --> 00:02:26.799
- HUGO: Perhaps...

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.746
... Perhaps there were rats.

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:40.697
Amicia.

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:41.475
Look!

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:44.189
It's one of the men that attacked the house.

00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:45.443
- AMICIA: The Inquisition.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.071
They're here.

00:02:57.664 --> 00:03:00.938
- SOLDIER 1: How'd they do that?
They're only fucking animals.

00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:02.184
- SOLDIER 2: Do I look like a rat?

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.374
How should I know?

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.112
- SOLDIER 1: Well... I'd say we'll never
get rid of these nests using stupid lime.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:08.168
- SOLDIER 2: Whatever happens...

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.638
We have to get out of here
before the sun goes down.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.177
They like the dark.

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:15.015
So back to business.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.796
- SOLDIER 1: That's an odd sound.

00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:44.096
Nah... Nothing.

00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:45.682
Nothing here.

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:01.682
- HUGO: Amicia, look!

00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:04.479
There's a bridge that leads to the farm.

00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:09.394
- SOLDIER: What a waste of time!

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:13.766
The Grand Inquisitor should just tell us
what he really wants from us.

00:04:24.886 --> 00:04:25.926
That noise...

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:28.122
What was it?

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.401
- SOLDIER 1: That should do it.

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:38.592
With that and the second barricade.
No one will ever get through.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:39.953
- SOLDIER 2: I'm going to the bridge.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.319
The cart will be back with the other barricade.

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:45.586
- AMICIA: (WHISPERING) We're trapped!

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.946
- HUGO: (WHISPERING) There's a hole in the wall.

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:49.628
- AMICIA: (WHISPERING) I'm too big.

00:04:49.828 --> 00:04:52.526
You'll have to go in and open the window for me.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.733
- HUGO: (WHISPERING) But they'll see me.

00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:56.314
- AMICIA: (WHISPERING) I'll keep them busy. Trust me.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.740
- SOLDIER: That noise...

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.903
Better go see what it was.

00:05:08.357 --> 00:05:10.757
- AMICIA: (WHISPERING) Come on.
- HUGO: (WHISPERING) I'm going.

00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:21.821
- SOLDIER: Nah. Nothing to report.

00:05:22.974 --> 00:05:24.974
- AMICIA: Yes. Now it's my turn.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.235
- SOLDIER: 'gain?

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.797
I've got to know for sure.

00:05:46.487 --> 00:05:49.482
- AMICIA: (WHISPERING) Well done!
- HUGO: (WHISPERING) Amicia,
we have to get out of here.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.751
- SOLDIER: Still nothing.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.780
(CART WITH HORSE SOUNDS)

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:55.662
Forget it!

00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:11.317
- SOLDIER: What's all the racket?

00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:18.981
- AMICIA: Oh no! They've blocked off the farm.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.029
- SOLDIER 1: Tell Lord Nicholas that the road is blocked.

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.598
Any person or vehicle that wants to get through
is to be stopped and searched.

00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:26.161
- SOLDIER 2: And what are we looking for exactly?

00:06:26.273 --> 00:06:27.431
- SOLDIER 1: A five-year-old kid.

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:28.836
Hugo de Rune.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.161
Brown hair, blue eyes.

00:06:30.352 --> 00:06:32.485
- HUGO: Are they talking about me? Why me?

00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:34.824
- AMICIA: Shh... Not now.

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.931
- SOLDIER 1: ...Very important, I was told.

00:06:39.218 --> 00:06:42.408
Lord Nicholas has his orders direct from the Grand Inquisitor himself.

00:06:42.678 --> 00:06:44.358
So keep your eyes peeled.

00:07:06.983 --> 00:07:08.871
- HUGO: Careful! There's a guard in there.

00:07:09.332 --> 00:07:10.332
- AMICIA: Yes.

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:21.669
- SOLDIER: Where was that noise coming from? Over there!

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:28.642
- AMICIA: Careful how you land.
- HUGO: Yes.

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:37.898
Amicia.

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.065
- AMICIA: What?

00:08:39.902 --> 00:08:42.314
- HUGO: What did I do? Why are they looking for me?

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:43.942
- AMICIA: You didn't do anything.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.751
It's...

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:47.403
They're the ones who did something.

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:51.109
- HUGO: If they catch us, will they hurt us?

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:54.340
- AMICIA: They're not going to catch us, alright?

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:55.588
- HUGO: Alright.

00:09:05.585 --> 00:09:06.625
- AMICIA: Hugo?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760
Hugo.

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.035
Where are you?

00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.535
Ah... Hugo, it's not funny.

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:34.258
Hugo.
- HUGO: Oh, you've found me. (LAUGHTER)

00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:37.934
- AMICIA: Did you really think this is the time to be playing games?
- HUGO: But...

00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:39.759
- AMICIA: Do you want they guards to catch you?

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.118
Don't do that again!

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.420
- HUGO: Sorry.

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:47.266
- AMICIA: (WHISPERING) They're here.

00:09:49.072 --> 00:09:51.338
- HUGO: Hey, piggy. You should hide.

00:09:51.564 --> 00:09:52.764
It's dangerous.

00:09:53.344 --> 00:10:07.629
(DISTANT CHATTER)

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.338
Oh... They're everywhere.

00:10:51.878 --> 00:10:53.132
- SOLDIER: I did...

00:10:53.354 --> 00:10:55.488
I did hear something over there.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.875
- SOLDIER: Well, that sound...

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:20.167
Came from over there, didn't it?

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.650
I...uh...

00:11:35.967 --> 00:11:36.967
No.

00:11:37.174 --> 00:11:38.854
There's nothing there.

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:47.111
- SOLDIER 1: Hey... Saw one of ours along the trail earlier.

00:11:47.309 --> 00:11:48.829
Dead as a doornail.

00:11:49.174 --> 00:11:50.087
Shouldn't we bury him?

00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:51.158
- SOLDIER 2: Had he been bitten?

00:11:51.238 --> 00:11:51.753
- SOLDIER 1: Yeah.

00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:52.731
- SOLDIER 2: Did you touch him?

00:11:52.786 --> 00:11:53.220
- SOLDIER 1: Nah.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.488
- SOLDIER 2: Good. Because when a rat bites you
it poisons your blood.

00:11:56.766 --> 00:12:02.854
You'll get boils all over
and everyone around you can get it and die too.
That's why it's called The Bite.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.163
- SOLDIER 1: Well, then...

00:12:04.243 --> 00:12:06.576
Think we'll just leave where he is.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.356
- SOLDIER 1: What's all the noise?

00:12:15.542 --> 00:12:17.742
- SOLDIER 2: What was that noise?

00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:31.888
- SOLDIER 1: Well... it was nothing.

00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:35.121
- SOLDIER 2: ...back to camp.
Shit, it's nearly dark.

00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:25.899
- SOLDIER: That noise...

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:28.271
I think it came from over there.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.388
- SOLDIER: What was that?

00:13:34.238 --> 00:13:35.213
Strange...

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:48.690
- HUGO: So they can't see us anymore.

00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:50.716
- AMICIA: No, they can't.

00:13:50.786 --> 00:13:53.897

- AMICIA: Fall back? What's happening?

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:16.419
Hugo...
(HIGH PITCH NOISE)

00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:18.613
We can't stop. Not here.

00:14:19.324 --> 00:14:21.004
- HUGO: I feel... funny.

00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:21.974
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:14:22.101 --> 00:14:24.968
You'll be able to rest
when we get to Laurentius' place.

00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:26.916
- HUGO: Ah... my head...

00:14:27.268 --> 00:14:28.268
It hurts...

00:14:30.278 --> 00:14:32.389
- AMICIA: I don't know what to do, Hugo.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.690
What would Mummy do?

00:14:33.754 --> 00:14:35.039
- HUGO: Give me medicine.

00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:36.690
- AMICIA: I can carry you.

00:14:36.738 --> 00:14:38.418
That's the best I can do.

00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:40.131
Come on. Climb up.

00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:54.829

00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:56.913
- AMICIA: I know.

00:14:57.025 --> 00:14:59.611
- HUGO: That must be why I feel all funny.

00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:02.838
- AMICIA: You're just tired.

00:15:04.247 --> 00:15:05.607
- HUGO: I miss her.

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:08.646

- HUGO: Alright.
