00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.943
VIII - OUR HOME

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:33.776
(CHILLING MUSIC PLAYING)

00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:38.151
- AMICIA: (GROANS)

00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:41.459
- HUGO: You're having a bad dream?

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:45.136
- AMICIA: Are you...

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:46.856
Are you awake already?

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.824
- HUGO: Yes. I found lots and lots and <i>lots</i> of things.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.022
Come and see.
You'd really like them.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.531
Come on, come on!
(METAL OBJECT DROPS ON THE GROUND)

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:01.035
- AMICIA: What's that noise?

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:03.418
- HUGO: It's Lucas. Follow me! You'll see!

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:06.973
- AMICIA: Right... This will wake me up...
Hopefully.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.570
- HUGO: Down here!

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:19.375
Lucas!
- LUCAS: Oh! There you are!

00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:20.235
- AMICIA: Sleep well?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.159
- LUCAS: Not a wink.
This laboratory is in bad shape.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.722
But it inspired me.

00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.311
I'm on the brink of completing the <i>Great Work</i>.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:28.378
And you...

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.719
You can help me.

00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:31.251
- HUGO: Oh, yes yes!

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:32.545
What do we have to do?

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:35.447
- LUCAS: Amicia, I need the phial
from the left-hand table.

00:01:35.492 --> 00:01:36.876
- AMICIA: Er... Alright.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.304
- HUGO: And me? And me?

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.469
What can I do?

00:01:39.477 --> 00:01:41.150
- LUCAS: We need light for the last step.

00:01:41.207 --> 00:01:42.702
Hugo, go get the candle.

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:44.404
- HUGO: I can do that!

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.967
- AMICIA: Ugh... That must be it.

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:52.872
- HUGO: Here.

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.483
- AMICIA: Alchemists lived here.

00:01:56.207 --> 00:01:58.103
Might be Launrentius' tool.

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.695
Here. Anything else?

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:18.114
- LUCAS: Uh... yes. The concentrated laurel sap.
It's just behind me.

00:02:18.215 --> 00:02:19.007
- AMICIA: I'll get it.

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:20.447
- HUGO: What's the <i>Great Work</i>?

00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:21.440
Can I eat it?

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:24.398
- LUCAS: It's the elixir that will illuminate your path.

00:02:24.488 --> 00:02:27.021
A beacon for the bearer of the Macula.

00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:29.144
It came to me during the night.

00:02:29.778 --> 00:02:31.378
- AMICIA: That's it.

00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:38.396
Here.
- LUCAS: Good.

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:39.919
So...

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.889
The angle's tear...

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:43.639
The pinnacle of alchemy...

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:45.398
- AMICIA: The elixir.

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:47.894
- HUGO: Wow!!

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:49.148
The <i>Great Work</i>!

00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:50.452
- LUCAS: Uh... it...

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:52.537
...wasn't supposed to do that.

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.322
- AMICIA: It doesn't matter, Lucas.

00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:58.498
Perhaps, we...

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.592
...should let you rest, right Hugo?

00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.561
- HUGO: Well done, Lucas.
You're a sorcerer.

00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:06.229
Amicia, come on.
- AMICIA: I'm coming.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:26.169
- HUGO: Amicia, where are you going?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.714
- AMICIA: It's alright. You can come.

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:30.506
Where does that lead to?

00:03:58.682 --> 00:03:59.682
Oh...

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:00.698
A grave.

00:04:02.445 --> 00:04:04.684
- HUGO: Who is it?
- AMICIA: I don't know.

00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:06.599
We can say something if you'd like.

00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:09.841
- HUGO: Sorry to disturb you.
We don't have any candles...

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:11.533
...but we'll leave you in peace.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.825
- AMICIA: And thanks for looking after us.

00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:15.331
Come on! Let's go!

00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:53.617
By the way, have you seen Mélie?
- HUGO: No.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:55.635
- AMICIA: Uh... She's...

00:04:55.714 --> 00:04:57.080
Maybe she's already gone.

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.090
- HUGO: Oh no! I wanted to say goodbye to her.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.586
- AMICIA: We'll have to patch up these straw mattresses.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.461
We've got a lot of work to do.

00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:44.476
Oh yes, the things we found.

00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:47.654
This would stop us losing them from older mess.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.844
Hugo's waiting for me.
I better go.

00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:46.403
Wow... This castle must've been empty for centuries.

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:52.089
- HUGO: (SHOUTING)

00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:53.383
- AMICIA: Wow.

00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:56.377
- HUGO: Come on, Amicia.
Let's both do it!

00:06:57.146 --> 00:06:59.919
(BOTH SHOUTING)
(LAUGHTER)

00:07:00.024 --> 00:07:01.820
- MÉLIE: Having fun, are you?

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:03.812
I'm sure the Inquisition are, too.

00:07:03.826 --> 00:07:05.987
- AMICIA: Mélie! We thought you'd gone!

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:07.447
- MÉLIE: Come on.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:09.087
We need to talk.

00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:29.660
- AMICIA: What's the matter?

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:31.262
- MÉLIE: This castle is a ruin.

00:07:31.286 --> 00:07:33.239
- AMICIA: Ah...
- MÉLIE: Not exactly what you need.

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:37.020
Whoever built this place
really didn't want to be fucked with.

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:38.867
Be good and you'll be fine.

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:41.889
- AMICIA: So... you're going to find Arthur?

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:43.895
If I can help...

00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:45.622
- MÉLIE: He's my problem.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.535
You heard what I heard.

00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:51.864
Those Inquisition dogs took him to the Bastion.
I know where to look.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.140
I'll find him.

00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:55.075
- HUGO: Amicia, look!

00:07:55.192 --> 00:07:56.632
- MÉLIE: Listen...

00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:57.692
With Hugo...

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:00.817
It doesn't look easy but believe me...

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.000
It's worth it.

00:08:02.427 --> 00:08:03.787
He will save you.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.204
They always end up saving us.

00:08:06.864 --> 00:08:08.544
Even if... you know...

00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:09.661
Brothers...

00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.895
Sometimes you just want to kill them.

00:08:11.927 --> 00:08:13.598
- HUGO: The symbol, Amicia.

00:08:13.614 --> 00:08:15.294
- AMICIA: I believe you.

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:17.895
Anyway, don't leave without saying goodbye.

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.629
- MÉLIE: (SCOFFS) As if that was my style.

00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:22.559
- HUGO: Amicia, please come.

00:08:22.723 --> 00:08:25.323
- AMICIA: Yes, Hugo. What did you find?

00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:30.770
- HUGO: Down there! It's the drawing.

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:31.817
- AMICIA: What drawing?

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.598
- HUGO: The one in the dining room.

00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:35.035
I'll show you. Come on.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.981
- AMICIA: I'm following you.

00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:54.051
- HUGO: Look! It's the same symbols.
- AMICIA: You're right.

00:08:54.114 --> 00:08:55.864
Alchemist coat of arms, maybe?

00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:57.895
- HUGO: Have you seen the tree?
- AMICIA: The tree?

00:08:57.942 --> 00:08:59.742
- HUGO: Come on! Over here!

00:09:03.552 --> 00:09:04.552
(LAUGHTER)

00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:09.927
(LAUGHTER)

00:09:09.942 --> 00:09:10.942
Come back!

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.598
Where are you going?
(LAUGHTER)

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:15.035
- AMICIA: (CHUCKLES)
You've found new friends.

00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:16.763
- HUGO: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:44.067
Amicia.

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:58.645
I'm sorry. I'm sick.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.448
- AMICIA: No, no no!

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.714
Listen, we're going to find a way to cure you.

00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:14.168
And there're Lucas and Mélie now, you know.

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:17.442
- HUGO: Lucas, come see the butterflies.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.379
- LUCAS: Looks like someone's having a good time.
- HUGO: (LAUGHS)

00:10:24.302 --> 00:10:25.739
- AMICIA: It's getting bigger.

00:10:25.785 --> 00:10:28.879
(LAUGHTER)

00:10:29.302 --> 00:10:30.660
- LUCAS: Yes...

00:10:30.802 --> 00:10:33.602
The Macula is spreading through his blood.

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:37.301
The book says there are several thresholds
in the process.

00:10:37.473 --> 00:10:39.457
And at each threshold...

00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:41.263
 the carrier may be lost.

00:10:41.677 --> 00:10:43.489
- AMICIA: How much time do we have?

00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:47.707
- LUCAS: Very little.
Hugo is nearing the first threshold.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.020
My Master and your mother
were trying to slow the process down.

00:10:51.114 --> 00:10:52.192
- AMICIA: But how?

00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:53.935
What were they doing?

00:10:54.426 --> 00:10:56.957
- LUCAS: They were working
on a very complex elixir...

00:10:57.036 --> 00:10:58.770
That would allow him time to prepare it.

00:10:58.848 --> 00:11:01.739
- AMICIA: And do you know how to do it?
- LUCAS: I don't have their knowledge.

00:11:01.802 --> 00:11:04.810
But their work was inspired
by a forbidden book.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.395
The Sanguinis Itinera...
- AMICIA: So, perhaps...

00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:09.410
With the book... we could...
- LUCAS: I'm afraid not.

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:12.254
The Sanguinis Itinera is dangerous.

00:11:12.302 --> 00:11:14.723
It is sealed together with other works.

00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:16.719
In the university's basement.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.442
Just getting there would be near impossible.

00:11:19.489 --> 00:11:20.689
Suicidal, even.

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:22.747
- AMICIA: Normally, yes. But...

00:11:22.802 --> 00:11:25.051
If we take advantage of the current chaos...

00:11:25.114 --> 00:11:29.551
We might have a chance.
- MÉLIE: I know the place, it's in town
not far from where they keep my brother.

00:11:29.692 --> 00:11:33.276
If you're ready to take that risk.
I can help you get in.

00:11:33.364 --> 00:11:34.964
- AMICIA: Thank you!

00:11:35.302 --> 00:11:37.723
- MÉLIE: Right, I'll get my belongings together.

00:11:37.786 --> 00:11:41.223
Meet me inside when you need to leave.
- LUCAS: In that case, you'll need some equipments.

00:11:41.348 --> 00:11:42.788
I'll get it ready.

00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:44.783
- AMICIA: Hugo.

00:11:45.302 --> 00:11:47.926
I'm really sorry. I need to leave.

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:50.942
- HUGO: Don't worry. I'll stay with Lucas.
- AMICIA: Good!

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:52.492
I'll be back soon.

00:12:02.927 --> 00:12:03.927
Father...

00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:05.286
Mother...

00:12:06.005 --> 00:12:07.685
You'll always be here.

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:09.333
With us.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.192
- MÉLIE: At last...

00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:33.973
Alright, come on.

00:12:34.052 --> 00:12:35.957
- LUCAS: Here. And one last thing...

00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:40.457
Laurentius told me once that there're roses
scattered along the path to the book.

00:12:40.536 --> 00:12:42.832
So keep your eyes opened.
- AMICIA: Roses.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.240
Alright, we will.
