IX - IN THE SHADOW OF RAMPARTS

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.645
(INSECTS CHIRPING)

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.796
- MÉLIE: The first rule of survival
is hitting between the legs.

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:23.593
- AMICIA: Wouldn't the head be quicker?

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.140
- MÉLIE: You're way too soft.

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:27.671
Shh... There is the town ramparts.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.890
- AMICIA: What's that crowd on the bridge?

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:56.866
- MÉLIE: It's the ... They're being evacuated.

00:00:57.297 --> 00:00:59.203
- AMICIA: Let me guess...
<i>The Bite</i>'s here.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.468
- MÉLIE: Exactly.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.218
And when there's <i>The Bite</i>,
you'll also find...

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:04.593
- AMICIA: (CONTINUES)
...The Inquisition.

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:07.001
- MÉLIE: Aren't you the smart one.

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:17.469
No!

00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:21.093
- AMICIA: Did you know him?

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:22.516
- MÉLIE: A thief.

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:24.242
I used to work with him.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.620
He was gifted.

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:28.296
- AMICIA: So that's the punishment
for stealing.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:29.093
Death.

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.484
- MÉLIE: I don't want to find Arthur
with that kind of collar.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.316
- AMICIA: Come on.
Let's go.

00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:45.343
Over to you, Mélie.
- MÉLIE: I'll open this...

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.875
...then I'll go take care of Arthur.

00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:48.531
- AMICIA: Alright, so...

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.296
Where will I find the university?

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:52.484
- MÉLIE: It's a big building
at the other end.

00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:53.562
You can't miss it.

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:55.078
- AMICIA: Do you think...

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.593
We'll see each other again?

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:59.171
- MÉLIE: I hope so.
You owe me.

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.266
Shit.

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:03.357
That means you're not allowed to die.
- AMICIA: (SCOFFS)

00:02:03.563 --> 00:02:04.687
I'll do my best.

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:07.334
- MÉLIE: There you go. Go on.
Get going.

00:02:07.906 --> 00:02:10.250
(DOOR CREAKING)

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:14.007
Good luck.
- AMICIA: You too.

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:16.468
(DOOR CREAKING)

00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:17.563
(DOOR SHUTS)

00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:35.390
(DISTANT CHATTER)

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:40.015
Those bastards.
What were they doing?

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:18.953
Wow...

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:20.578
Over there.

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.492
That must be the university.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.468
All that light. I don't like this.

00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:47.453
Right.

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:51.750
It's way ... But you can do this.

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:53.172
Here we go.

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.953
- SOLDIER: Hey, you in there!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.265
This is your last warning
before we drag you out on your arse.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:10.437
(INAUDIBLE)

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:12.656
Bloody ...

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:14.515
- AMICIA: Careful.

00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:16.140
- SOLDIER: Last call.

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.640
By order of the Grand Inquisitor Vitalis.

00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:21.765
Martial law is in ...

00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:25.203
And the city under the control
of The Inquisition.

00:05:25.578 --> 00:05:29.234
Any people who choose to remain
will be arrested.

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.093
And executed.

00:05:32.234 --> 00:05:33.593
- AMICIA: Martial law?

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:34.774
Unbelievable!

00:05:35.453 --> 00:05:36.453
Why now?

00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:29.671
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:06:41.297 --> 00:07:03.281
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:07:03.703 --> 00:07:05.375
- SOLDIER: What was that noise?

00:08:04.594 --> 00:08:08.178
- SOLDIER: That noise...
I think it came from over there.

00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:22.612
Nothing to report.

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:43.578
Again?

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:45.781
That's not right.
I'll go and see.

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:21.321
I don't know where I am.

00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:23.187
Maybe ... still alive.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.031
- SOLDIER: ... and keep quiet.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.156
- AMICIA: What's going on?
- WOMAN: No!

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:29.078
He is my husband!

00:10:29.188 --> 00:10:30.500
- SOLDIER: He <i>was</i> your husband.

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:32.812
It's all over for him now so get lost!

00:10:32.844 --> 00:10:34.921
- WOMAN: But by myself...
(SOBBING)

00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:37.187
I can't leave without him...

00:10:37.313 --> 00:10:40.140
- SOLDIER: Shut up!
You heard the martial law?

00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:41.671
Wanna die before he does?

00:10:41.703 --> 00:10:43.383
- AMICIA: Oh my goodness.

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:49.484
- SOLDIER: Listen to him.
Fuck off! Now!

00:10:49.563 --> 00:10:51.243
- WOMAN: Oh lord! Lord!

00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:55.640
- SOLDIER: Urhh... I'm tired of your bullshit.
I didn't sign up for this.

00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:04.571
- AMICIA: Urghh... God...

00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:13.734
(RATS SQUEAKING)

00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:26.046
- SOLDIER: Hey.

00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:27.796
Where is the hanging man?

00:11:27.844 --> 00:11:29.124
- AMICIA: Oh no.

00:11:29.349 --> 00:11:31.883
- SOLDIER: Uh... That was the noise...

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:35.660
And those fucking rats
are there already to eat him.

00:11:44.098 --> 00:11:48.631
Well... I see something
I can pinch around here.

00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:15.742
- AMICIA: Ugh... When will it stop?

00:12:34.324 --> 00:12:36.296
They've all been executed.

00:12:38.588 --> 00:12:42.081
(DISTANT CHATTER)

00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:22.321
Alright... Stay calm...

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.423
Think of Hugo...

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:26.815
###

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.130
- SOLDIER: For god's sake, what now?

00:15:48.227 --> 00:15:49.667
Better go and see.

00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:09.457
Nah, still nothing.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.852
I'm not mad, am I?

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.949
- AMICIA: ###

00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:25.259
Ugh...

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:26.699
It's sticky.

00:17:19.617 --> 00:17:22.945
- SOLDIER: Nah, nothing. Nothing here.

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.608
- AMICIA: (EXHALES) I made it.

00:18:09.725 --> 00:18:12.844
Ugh... But I'll never forget the smell.

00:18:25.948 --> 00:18:28.521
The university! See!

00:18:28.593 --> 00:18:31.125
Keep going. The cementery.

00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:32.903
It's on the way.

00:18:33.176 --> 00:18:35.843
I really don't want to go through there.

00:18:38.078 --> 00:18:39.078
Locked.

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.697
If only Mélie was here.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.238
Come on, there has to be another way to get in.

00:19:02.689 --> 00:19:04.862
The Inquisition must have put it here.

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:06.543
Looks like it's ###.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.215
Huh, clever.

00:19:08.733 --> 00:19:11.212
The Grand Inquisitor doesn't ###.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.112
- MAN: What? Hey! What the hell!
(SCREAMING)

00:20:21.132 --> 00:20:22.998
- AMICIA: That'll teach you!

00:20:22.819 --> 00:20:23.819
(BODY THUDS)

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.770
A window. Perfect!

00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:46.192
Let's get out of here.

00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:01.301
- SOLDIER 1: Magister. The Episanguis.

00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:03.759
- ALCHEMIST: Hah... Let's see...

00:21:11.826 --> 00:21:13.940
(CHEMICAL SIZZLING)

00:21:15.017 --> 00:21:16.111
Perfect.

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:18.375
- SOLDIER 2: If I ###...

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.080
We know it comes from those rats but...

00:21:20.991 --> 00:21:22.819
What's it for?

00:21:30.563 --> 00:21:32.763
- ALCHEMIST: We call this Odoris.

00:21:33.179 --> 00:21:34.779 position:80%
- SOLDIER 2: Woah...

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:35.493
- SOLDIER 1: Urgh...

00:21:35.995 --> 00:21:39.728
- ALCHEMIST: That is just
one of the effects of the Episanguis...

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.837
...when we mix it with sulphur.

00:21:42.199 --> 00:21:44.866
But that's not what we're interested in.

00:21:45.729 --> 00:21:50.385
- SOLDIER 2: But... So why don't we
let our units use it, eh?

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.490
It could...

00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:53.205
- ALCHEMIST: It is too precious!

00:21:52.953 --> 00:21:56.709
Each Episanguis crystal
must be kept for our project.

00:21:57.134 --> 00:21:59.811
Particularly as... in this form.

00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:02.060
It has been a source of some...

00:22:02.212 --> 00:22:03.926
How should I say...

00:22:04.194 --> 00:22:06.318
<i>"Regrettable accidents."</i>

00:22:06.878 --> 00:22:09.950
Deliver it the bastion.
That is enough for today.

00:22:11.104 --> 00:22:13.571
- SOLDIER 2: <i>"Regrettable accidents?"</i>

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.886
- SOLDIER 1: Imagine you spill some on your feet...

00:22:15.915 --> 00:22:18.157
You have to do your patrol on your eyes.

00:22:17.624 --> 00:22:19.290
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.825
(GATE CLOSES)

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.415
- AMICIA: Episanguis... What's that?

00:22:31.576 --> 00:22:33.096
I need to see this.

00:22:38.346 --> 00:22:41.524
They're gone. ### Just a cementery.

00:22:58.821 --> 00:23:00.821
What are you so excited about?

00:23:04.063 --> 00:23:05.063
Well well...

00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:10.981
So this is Episanguis.

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:13.833
Right. Episanguis... Sulphur...

00:23:14.644 --> 00:23:16.911
We have to crust them up together.

00:23:17.176 --> 00:23:19.490
Now, we just have to try it now.

00:23:20.313 --> 00:23:22.493
Lucas, this one is for you.

00:23:46.034 --> 00:23:47.328
It's working!

00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:50.601
This will save my life!
I need to find more.

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:53.429
Remember, the effect doesn't last long.

00:24:23.364 --> 00:24:25.602
Over there. It looks like the exit.

00:24:25.688 --> 00:24:27.716
Come on. It's not that far.

00:24:37.164 --> 00:24:38.907
The ground is collapsed.

00:24:38.764 --> 00:24:41.564
I need to find something to ### myself up.

00:25:08.165 --> 00:25:09.165
A cart.

00:25:09.451 --> 00:25:12.459
If I could get it down there,
I could climb on it.

00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:22.783
Odoris won't keep them in there for long.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.275
I need to block them once and for all.

00:26:32.097 --> 00:26:34.201
Now, the lantern. Quickly.

00:26:41.014 --> 00:26:42.014
Yes!

00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:10.761
Alright, please tell me this can still roll.

00:27:27.796 --> 00:27:29.110
Oh, oh no!

00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:34.330
That was... very discreet.

00:27:35.136 --> 00:27:36.936
Right, now just a bit more.

00:27:43.764 --> 00:27:46.978
You see? You're doing it!
You're getting there!

00:28:36.989 --> 00:28:39.426
My god. What happened here?

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:46.359
I'm getting closer.

00:28:46.738 --> 00:28:48.995
The ### really exists, Lucas.

00:28:52.893 --> 00:28:54.024
Oh Lord.

00:28:54.243 --> 00:28:56.843
The sick... they slaughtered them.

00:29:01.443 --> 00:29:03.310 line:20%
The rats... (COUGHS) They...

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:06.077 line:20%
They unleashed the rats.

00:29:06.803 --> 00:29:08.446 line:20%
Help me!

00:29:07.866 --> 00:29:09.203
- AMICIA: I can't!

00:29:09.307 --> 00:29:10.592
I'm sorry!

00:29:19.153 --> 00:29:20.673
I can't believe it!

00:29:20.458 --> 00:29:23.435
They used the rats...
against the sick!

00:29:31.258 --> 00:29:33.325 position:80% line:20%
- SOLDIER: Dirty little beasts!

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.463
- AMICIA: The Odoris... I could try...

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:50.475
It worked.

00:30:00.787 --> 00:30:01.787 line:20%
- MAN: Why?

00:30:02.777 --> 00:30:05.940 line:20%
- SOLDIER: Because it's too late for you!
Call it mercy!

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.080 line:20%
But don't worry.

00:30:10.213 --> 00:30:12.480 line:20%
All the others will soon be saved.

00:30:12.981 --> 00:30:17.152
(DISTANT CHATTERING)

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.113
- SOLDIER: Huh? What's all that noise?

00:31:52.531 --> 00:31:54.654
- AMICIA: Why are they still here?

00:31:54.695 --> 00:31:57.266
### Episanguis... Cages...

00:31:57.568 --> 00:31:59.635
This is just not an evacuation.

00:32:51.787 --> 00:32:55.729 line:20%
- MAN: You there... I'm burning up!
Inside!

00:32:55.774 --> 00:32:57.294 line:20%
Tell me what to do!

00:32:57.231 --> 00:32:59.576
- AMICIA: I... I don't know.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.573 line:20%
Water!

00:33:02.997 --> 00:33:05.098
Oh no! Don't drink that!

00:33:08.045 --> 00:33:10.521
Urgh... This is a nightmare!

00:33:12.083 --> 00:33:13.083
Come on.

00:33:13.302 --> 00:33:14.302
Be brave.

00:33:14.687 --> 00:33:16.620
The university must be close.

00:33:33.227 --> 00:33:35.274
(DISTANT HORN SOUND)

00:33:34.193 --> 00:33:35.713 line:20%
- MAN 1: He's coming!

00:33:35.403 --> 00:33:37.288 line:20%
### Vitalis' coming.

00:33:37.412 --> 00:33:39.851 line:20%
- MAN 2: The Grand Inquisitor is here!

00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:43.604
Vitalis. The butcher
who killed my father works for you.

00:33:44.125 --> 00:33:46.192
His blood is on your hands too.

00:36:48.584 --> 00:36:50.479
Yes! Finally!

00:36:59.668 --> 00:37:01.935
What on earth are they doing here?

00:37:04.361 --> 00:37:08.370
- SOLDIER 1: Shit! I really thought
I was going to thump one of those alchemists.

00:37:08.395 --> 00:37:12.703
- SOLDIER 2: ###. They're a bit ###
but at least they know how to read.

00:37:12.714 --> 00:37:15.961
- SOLDIER 1: That doesn't give them the right
to act like arseholes!

00:37:16.017 --> 00:37:17.017
Anyway...

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.395
One of them said Vitalis isn't doing...

00:37:19.435 --> 00:37:21.115
- SOLDIER 2: ### coming.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.110
We'll have to pray for him.
