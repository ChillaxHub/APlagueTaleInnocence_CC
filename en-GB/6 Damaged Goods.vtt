VI - DAMAGED GOODS

00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:27.843
(HEAVY FOOTSTEPS)

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.968
- SOLDIER: Hey! (KICKS THE CAGE)
Wakey, wakey.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.711
Better eat something.

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:34.602
You're lucky, you know.

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:38.101
Your everyday corpse robber
usually gets a sword in the belly.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.645
No questions asked.

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:41.031
But, me...

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:43.823
I've got an eye for that fancy jewellery.

00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:47.765
And you're lucky I like gold
better than blood. Lady de Rune.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.109
- AMICIA: Where is my brother?

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:49.921
- SOLDIER: Shut up!

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.835
The better you look,
the higher the ransom.

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.444
Might've bruised the goods
a bit too much already.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.468
- AMICIA: The ransom? Who's paying it?

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:59.328
- SOLDIER: Alright, you'll see soon enough.

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:02.926
You're not in your château anymore
so cork it, alright?

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.397
- AMICIA: Mangy dog.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:13.296
(CROWS CAW)

00:01:13.984 --> 00:01:15.584
(LOCK PICKING SOUND)

00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:51.078
Who are you?

00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:52.812
- MÉLIE: Mélie.

00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:54.062
The other one is Arthur.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.437
- AMICIA: This is all your fault.
Where is my brother?

00:01:56.547 --> 00:01:58.814
- MÉLIE: Hey.
Keep your voice down.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.796
- AMICIA: Those dogs took my sling.

00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:02.644
- MÉLIE: You don't need it.

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.978
The cart. Arthur will make him move.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.437
- AMICIA: What? How?

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:15.765
- MÉLIE: A distraction.

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:19.640
He's waiting for us to tell him where
and what so keep your eyes open.

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:26.209
- AMICIA: The cart.
- MÉLIE: That'll do the trick.

00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:26.989
Get ready.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.148
- AMICIA: For what?
- MÉLIE: To follow me.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.833
- AMICIA: So he's your brother?

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.056
- MÉLIE: Come on.

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:44.012
- SOLDIER 1: We got an idea
how many deaths on our side?

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:45.418
- SOLDIER 2: It's hard to say.

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:46.978
Thousands for sure.

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:49.998
But the rats make counting difficult.

00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:53.338
- AMICIA: Hugo is alone with those butchers.

00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:54.637
- MÉLIE: They won't hurt him.

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:56.287
- AMICIA: You don't understand.

00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:57.391
If he's afraid...

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.451
- MÉLIE: You have to be patient.

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:00.851
(DISTANT CHATTER)

00:03:00.907 --> 00:03:02.587
We have to clear the way.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.838
- AMICIA: The barrel with the spears.
- MÉLIE: Well done.

00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:27.177
Get ready to go.

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.159
- MÉLIE: Good job, Arthur.
Let's go.

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:43.612
Watch out for the bottles.

00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:10.345
Be careful.

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:25.174
Stay down.
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:04:25.275 --> 00:04:29.917
(THUNDERING NOISE)

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:47.596
- MÉLIE: Let's go.

00:05:07.462 --> 00:05:08.582
- ARCHER: Wot?

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:09.815
- MÉLIE: Be careful.

00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:13.332
- SOLDIER 1: It was the hell of a fucking victory I'm telling ya.

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:16.122
Guyenne belongs to England again for sure.

00:05:16.268 --> 00:05:17.238
- SOLDIER 2: Oh yeah?

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:20.687
Take a look out there and you'll see
that Guyenne belongs to the <i>focking</i> rats.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.142
- SOLDIER 1: All you need
is a torch to get rid of them.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.694
Bye bye, rats.

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:28.667
- AMICIA: Look! The pot.

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:30.534
- MÉLIE: Yeah.
Well spotted.

00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:36.848
Now! Left!

00:05:37.172 --> 00:05:40.244
- SOLDIER: We'll be careful.
You know our orders.

00:05:45.464 --> 00:05:47.674
(DIGGING SOUND)

00:05:50.754 --> 00:05:53.455
- SOLDIER 1: What sort of prisoner
is worth such  a high ransom?

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:55.060
- SOLDIER 2: Valois children.

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:57.528
The son and daughter of the Knight Robert de Rune.

00:05:57.585 --> 00:05:59.482
- SOLDIER 1: The Knight of the Tree more like.

00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:02.305
- SOLDIER 2: His fighting skills
from the time of the war are legendary.

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.750
But he's no longer in the service of King Philip.

00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:07.763
- SOLDIER 1: It is rather odd
to be so interested in the children.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.497
- SOLDIER 2: Why don't you
go ask the sister some questions?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.658
She must be awake.

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:12.707
- AMICIA: Oh no!

00:06:12.786 --> 00:06:13.845
- MÉLIE: Don't worry.

00:06:13.902 --> 00:06:15.582
It was bound to happen.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.020
Let's see...

00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:30.627
This...

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:32.871
This...

00:06:33.344 --> 00:06:34.544
Not bad at all.

00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:36.824
- AMICIA: What are you doing?
This is not the time.

00:06:36.893 --> 00:06:39.214
- MÉLIE: I'm making your rescue profitable.

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:40.497
That's what I'm doing.

00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:41.747
- AMICIA: What about this chest?

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.738
- MÉLIE: I saw... powder...
Probably for alchemy.

00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:45.765
Useless.

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:46.926
- AMICIA: I can use it.

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.849
- MÉLIE: If you want me to open it, just say.

00:06:49.962 --> 00:06:51.829
- AMICIA: Would you? Please.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.198
(LOCK PICKING SOUND)

00:06:58.623 --> 00:07:00.489
- MÉLIE: There you go.
Enjoy.

00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:02.243
- AMICIA: Well done.

00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:04.247
- MÉLIE: Come on.
- AMICIA: I'm coming.

00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:13.633
- MÉLIE: Silence.

00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:16.624
- AMICIA: Mélie, not that way!
There're loads of them.

00:07:26.714 --> 00:07:29.203
(THUNDERING NOISE)

00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:32.233
- SOLDIER: We're running out of bread and wine.

00:07:43.098 --> 00:07:44.203
- AMICIA: You're crazy.

00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:46.725
- MÉLIE: What? We got through, didn't we?

00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:47.874
- AMICIA: Just!

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.504
(SOLDIERS PRACTISING IN THE BACKGROUND)

00:08:00.362 --> 00:08:02.042
- SOLDIER 1: Hey kid!

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.833
- AMICIA: (GASPS) My brother!

00:08:03.856 --> 00:08:04.971
- MÉLIE: Looks like it.

00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:06.445
- AMICIA: Quickly.

00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:08.498
- SOLDIER 1: Soon you'll be far away from here.

00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:10.499
- HUGO: Amicia, where is she?

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:14.681
- AMICIA: The bastards, the bastards!
- MÉLIE: Calm down!

00:08:14.892 --> 00:08:16.632
- HUGO: No, no please don't!

00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:20.440
- SOLDIER 1: Just be thankful that you're still alive...
- SOLDIER 2: Hey! The girl. The girl!

00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:23.922
- SOLDIER 1: Huh? What do you mean <i>the girl</i>?
Come on. Spit it out.

00:08:23.956 --> 00:08:25.469
- SOLDIER 2: The girl is escaped.

00:08:25.537 --> 00:08:28.695
The cage is opened n' everyone is looking for her.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.900
- SOLDIER 1: Shhhhit...

00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.001
Spread out!

00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:35.770
Watch the doors and stay in your toes.
A cage doesn't just open like that!

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.244
Might be the Valois' doing.

00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:38.991
- MÉLIE: Now's the time.

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:47.913
- AMICIA: Hugo, I'm here.

00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:48.895
- HUGO: Amicia!

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.637
- AMICIA: Are you alright? Are you hurt?

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:52.679
- HUGO: No. Get me out, please!

00:08:52.746 --> 00:08:54.275
- MÉLIE: We have to get that cage down.

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:58.203
- AMICIA: It's alright, Hugo. Listen. 
My sling, did they have it when they lock you up?

00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:02.077
- HUGO: Yes, they put it in the trunk there.
- AMICIA: Right.

00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:08.519
Mélie, can you look after it?

00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:13.739
(LOCK PICKING NOISE)

00:09:20.637 --> 00:09:24.509
Finally. Now Hugo.
I need to get the cage down.

00:09:27.116 --> 00:09:29.705
- SOLDIER: (IN THE DISTANCE) Shit, I don't believe it!
We're focked!

00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:33.701
- MÉLIE: Fortunately, they're busy.

00:09:34.872 --> 00:09:36.606
- AMICIA: Mélie, the lock.

00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:43.374
- MÉLIE: Easy.

00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:45.327
- HUGO: They said someone's going to take me.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.254
- AMICIA: It's alright, Hugo.
You're going to get out of here.

00:09:49.312 --> 00:09:50.840
- HUGO: Amicia.
- AMICIA: Oh.

00:09:50.863 --> 00:09:52.972
- HUGO: They said they were going to take me away.

00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:54.510
And I won't see you again.

00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:56.900
- AMICIA: Well, now you know it's not true.

00:09:56.946 --> 00:09:57.693
I'm here.

00:09:57.738 --> 00:09:59.322
- HUGO: We're staying together, right?

00:09:59.546 --> 00:10:00.751
- AMICIA: Of course.

00:10:00.785 --> 00:10:03.385
And we're going to go with Mélie.
She's here to help us.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:04.635
- HUGO: She's a thief!

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.978
- AMICIA: And she's sorry she turned us in earlier.

00:10:07.057 --> 00:10:07.938
Aren't you, Mélie?

00:10:07.972 --> 00:10:08.898
- MÉLIE: Yeah...

00:10:08.932 --> 00:10:10.132
I'm a bad girl.

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:11.978
Happy now? Can we go?

00:10:12.057 --> 00:10:14.077
- AMICIA: Take my hand, Hugo.
Let's get going.

00:10:14.144 --> 00:10:14.657
- HUGO: Yes.

00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:16.845
- MÉLIE: There's a way at the far end of the camp.

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:20.399
If you really know how to use that sling,
you better go first.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.810
- AMICIA: Uh huh.

00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:37.291
- SOLDIER: Still nothing.
Are you sure she didn't leave the camp?

00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:40.494
Spread out! Split up! And search the tents.

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:55.672
- SOLDIER: Nothing to report from my side.

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:17.969
She's just a kid. She must be holdin' up in a corner.

00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:29.356
- MÉLIE: Are you sure about that?

00:11:29.412 --> 00:11:32.548
- AMICIA: Completely. I've had enough of running.

00:11:34.412 --> 00:11:35.412
Come on.

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:39.313
- SOLDIER: Move it! She couldn't just get out like that.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:06.194
(REPEATING DIALOGUES)

- AMICIA: Do you want some more? I still have some!

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:50.906
Oh no.

00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:06.878
- NICHOLAS: I paid a ransom for the de Rune children
and I have to capture them myself?

00:13:07.308 --> 00:13:10.394
These Plantagenets are useless.

00:13:10.472 --> 00:13:13.812
- AMICIA: He killed my parents.
He's going to slaughter us!

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.570

00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:23.460

00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:25.960
- MÉLIE: The Inquisition?
What the hell did you do?

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:29.671
- AMICIA: Nothing. We didn't do anything.
They want Hugo.

00:13:30.355 --> 00:13:32.484
- MÉLIE: It's time to get out of here.

00:13:34.144 --> 00:13:35.944
This is our way out. Hurry!

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:38.983
- AMICIA: Don't slow down, Hugo. Follow Mélie.

00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:45.374
- NICHOLAS: Amicia! Stop running! Deliver Hugo to us.
- AMICIA: I won't let him get you.
- HUGO: He's here, Amicia!

- AMICIA: We don't have much time.

00:13:53.246 --> 00:13:57.581
- MÉLIE: Through here. Quick!
Locked! Shit!

00:14:01.739 --> 00:14:03.535
Done. Let's go.

- SOLDIER: You hear that? What the hell is it?
- MÉLIE: Archer to the left. Get down.

00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:15.137
Done! Let's go!

00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:20.723
That's there. That looks like a way out.
