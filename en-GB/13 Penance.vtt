00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Rodric beats Arthur at the sling!
- Arthur: That's not true! He was in front of the line!

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Rodric: (laughs) You're just rubbish!

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Lucas: Are you two arguing again?

5

He's...

...gone...
(music intensifies)

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo!

11
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Answer!

12
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo!

13
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh... my head... ah... gently now... gently...

14
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Don't... stop... Go on...

15
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
HUGO!

16
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Where... can he have gone?

17
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Think, Amicia... think!

18
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is that a... a village?

19
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Here?

20
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hey, wait! Did anyone see a child come through here?

21
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Please!

22
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Oh, Amicia... Are you feeling better?

23
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
How's the little one?

24
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Clervie? Is... Is that you?

25
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Have you seen Hugo?

26
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Did you shout at him again?

27
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: No! Absolutely not!

28
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Times are heard enough already without you two arguing...

29
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: But we weren't arguing any more.

30
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Amicia, a child never runs away without a reason.

31
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Open the door! I'm going to find him!

32
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Alright. But be careful...

33
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
An ill wind is on its way, Amicia...

34
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: What is that? What is going on?

35
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Laurentius: Amicia, I've been waiting for you...

36
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come with me.

37
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Laurentius?

38
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is that really you?

39
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Laurentius: Where is Hugo?

40
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: He... He's gone.

41
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Laurentius: (sighs)

42
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I knew this would happen.

43
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: i did take care of him!

44
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Laurentius: Then why did he leave?

45
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I don't know! I... I did everything I could to protect him.

46
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Even... horrible things...

47
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Laurentius: It is easy to spill blood! But to love... To protect...

48
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I'm going to find him!

49
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Laurentius: Then go! And pray there is still time!

50
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Mummy... I hear a noise outside.

51
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo... That's him!

52
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Mother?
- Béatrice: Amicia, come here.

53
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Yes, Mother.

54
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: Your brother's here.

55
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: How is he?

56
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: If he's back... it's because he's not very well.

57
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: But I did everything...

58
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: You hid the truth from him.

59
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: But...

60
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: His emotions, Amicia! I warned you!

61
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Let me see him...

62
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: He doesn't want to see you.

63
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Who are you talk8ing to, Mummy?

64
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I have to see him!

65
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: He doesn't need you anymore.

66
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: That's a lie!

67
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: (sighs)

68
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Go on then... See for yourself...

69
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo... Are you alright?

70
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Hugo: No!
- Amicia: What's the matter?

71
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Why did you leave?

72
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Why didn't you tell me Mummy was alive?

73
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It was for your own good, Hugo.

74
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: That's not true! You didn't want me to know!

75
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Don't say that!

76
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: You're jealous! Jealous! Let go of me!

77
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, NO!

78
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo...
- Hugo: (in the distant) Let me out!

79
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Where are you?

80
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Help me!

81
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Leave me alone!

82
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It's him!

83
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I want to go home.

84
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo!

85
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Let me go!

86
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: He's there... oh... thank you...

87
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Soldier: Stop shouting! Where's your sister, eh?

88
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia!

89
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I'm here! Everything's alright, Hugo! It's over!

90
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hey, are you alright? They didn't hurt you, did they?

91
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Hugo: No.
- Amicia: But why did you go off like that?

92
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I heard Mummy... She was calling me...

93
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It must have been a nightmare, that's all.

94
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I really thought it was her...

95
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
She was in pain and...

96
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: She can't feel pain where she is now. We talked about this.

97
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But...

98
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: She's gone, Hugo. You have to accept it. Let's go back.

99
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Alright.

100
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We must get back to the castle.

101
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: (in the distant) Hugo!

102
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Mummy! Amicia, it's Mummy!

103
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Amicia: What?
- Béatrice: (grunts in pain)

104
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: It's coming from over there!

105
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We have to go!

106
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: No! You're not going!

107
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But why? Let go of me!

108
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo!

109
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000

114
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: There! She's in there!

115
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Béatrice: (screams in pain)

116
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Mummy!

117
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Stop! It's not her!

118
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No!

119
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
NO!!

120
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo, I need you!!
(emotional music intensifies)

121
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I'm coming! Where are you?

122
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Amicia: It's not Mummy, Hugo!
- Ghost Soldiers: (echoing) Stay with us.

123
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Mummy? I can't see you!

124
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Amicia: No, no!
- Ghost Soldier: You're one of us now!

125
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Shut up! Let go of me!

126
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ghost Soldier: (echoing) Stay with us... You took our lives...

127
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I did it for him! And I'll kill you again if I had to!

128
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'LL KILL ALL OF YOU!

129
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh no...

130
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Not them...

131
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No!

132
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo... Is that you?

133
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000

Get out of my way!

137
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Let me...

138
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...through...

139
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000

144
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Let us go.

THEY'LL...

148
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
THEY'RE GOING TO...

148
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(screams in pain)
