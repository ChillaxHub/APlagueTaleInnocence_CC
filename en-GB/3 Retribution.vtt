III - RETRIBUTION

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.504
- AMICIA: (PANTING)

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:16.875
- HUGO: Look, Amicia.

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:18.727
- AMICIA: I...

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.352
I'm coming...

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.578
- HUGO: Wow...

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.406
Why are there candles?

00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:53.071
- AMICIA: The candles are... to show that you're thinking of someone.

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.093
- HUGO: Oh. Can I light one?

00:00:55.203 --> 00:00:57.797
- AMICIA: If you want to. Don't burn yourself.

00:00:57.953 --> 00:00:58.766
- HUGO: Thank you!

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:10.453
For Mummy and Daddy.

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:12.672
- AMICIA: Watch over them.

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:26.654
- HUGO: It's funny. The sound here...

00:01:26.797 --> 00:01:27.703
- AMICIA: There's an echo.

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:28.578
- HUGO: Hello!

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.578
- AMICIA: Hugo, there might be people here.

00:01:30.672 --> 00:01:31.391
- HUGO: Oh.

00:01:55.547 --> 00:02:00.921
- AMICIA: Forgive me for... the evil I have just committed... I never...

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:04.344
- HUGO: Amicia, you're really squeezing me.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:06.672
- AMICIA: Sorry.

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:19.953
- HUGO: Hey, look!

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:21.563
There's a broken window and a ladder.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.109
Climb up!

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.359
- HUGO: I hope it doesn't break like the other one.

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:26.250
- AMICIA: It won't, Hugo. Trust me.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.141
- HUGO: Amicia, there's someone there!

00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:33.063
- MONK: Children, what are you doing here?

00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:35.047
- AMICIA: Father! We need help!

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:39.265
- MONK: Leave! It's dangerous! You have no business being here!

00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:41.671
- AMICIA: Wait! Please! It's important!

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.281
We should go and talk to him.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:04.984
- HUGO: Is he the one who knows where Laurentius is?

00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:07.172
- AMICIA: It has to be him... It has to...

00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:10.554
- HUGO: Oh, they've broken everything.

00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:11.734
- AMICIA: What's going on here?

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.888
- HUGO: Perhaps they're building bigger beds?

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.328
- AMICIA: I don't think that's it.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.984
- HUGO: I know that smell.

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:37.766
- AMICIA: Medicinal herbs...

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:41.109
The monks must have put them in the water to purify themselves.

00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:42.969
Mother used to do the same.

00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:16.844
- HUGO: Flowers! They're so pretty!

00:04:20.297 --> 00:04:23.578
They're carnations. We had some in my herbarium.

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:25.203
But those ones are prettier.

00:04:25.344 --> 00:04:27.047
- AMICIA: Hugo, we have to keep moving.

00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:28.641
- HUGO: Wait, wait. Come here.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.391
- AMICIA: What?

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.219
- HUGO: It will protect you. And it's pretty, too.

00:04:32.328 --> 00:04:34.250
- AMICIA: Oh, alright.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:35.203
- HUGO: Now we can go.

00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:36.390
- AMICIA: Thank you, Hugo.

00:04:36.453 --> 00:04:37.516
- HUGO: You're welcome.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:19.578
- AMICIA: Father?

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:21.843
- MONK: You again!

00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:23.546
I told you to leave!
- AMICIA: Just a moment!

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.438
Just a...
- MONK: You have no idea!

00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:27.504
Leave while you still can!

00:05:26.938 --> 00:05:30.687
- AMICIA: Please! Someone has to help us! Do it for him at least.

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:42.047
- MONK: The Robert de Rune coat of arms.

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:44.054
- AMICIA: We are his children. We are looking for Laurentius...

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.071
..., the doctor,...

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.109
...Do you know him?

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:47.988
- MONK: Yes, yes, I know him.

00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.328
And I know he used to look after your family.

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:54.109
He spoke of you.

00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:57.688
I am Father Thomas.

00:05:58.047 --> 00:06:01.471
Your presence here is not a good sign.

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:05.154
- AMICIA: The Inquisition. They came and they...

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:14.321
- FATHER THOMAS: I can imagine. But what is happening here is far worse.

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:18.588
You must leave immediately, or you will die.

00:06:18.656 --> 00:06:21.188
- AMICIA: But Father, the villagers wanted to kill us.

00:06:22.188 --> 00:06:23.954
- FATHER THOMAS: They're mad, they're mad... I...

00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:27.369
Laurentius... Laurentius...

00:06:27.812 --> 00:06:31.328
No, I-I-I cannot leave the church... But...

00:06:31.563 --> 00:06:32.683
But an exit...

00:06:34.406 --> 00:06:38.788
...through the Crypt of the Three Saints! It may not be too late.

00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:42.704
I shall try and put you on the path to Laurentius' farm. But...

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:45.572
...after that...

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.305
May God watch over you.

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:52.904
All seems calmed for the moment.

00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:54.344
Come!

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:02.719
(DOOR SHUTS)

00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:07.054
Above all, be sure to stay in the light.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:11.888
- AMICIA: Father, why are there crosses on the village doors?

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:13.504
Is it really the plague?

00:07:13.578 --> 00:07:16.638
- FATHER THOMAS: It started with bites, during the night.

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:19.583
Then the sickness spread.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.708
 First in families. Then to everyone.

00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:27.371
Fever, boils. People started dying.

00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:30.788
And when we finally found out where it came from...

00:07:32.656 --> 00:07:34.488
...it was already too late.

00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.734
- AMICIA: And... where did it come from?

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.109
- FATHER THOMAS: We're nearly there.

00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:02.354
Brother Morel should be here. We are the last two remaining.

00:08:07.266 --> 00:08:08.266
(DOOR SHUTS)

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:17.531
Brother Morel?

00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:20.859
Stay here.

00:08:26.828 --> 00:08:28.406
Brother Morel!

00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:36.833
Brother?

(HIGH PITCH NOISE)

00:08:44.328 --> 00:08:45.688
- AMICIA: What is the matter?

00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:48.109
Father?

00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:52.078

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:14.888

- AMICIA: Oh my God! Hugo, stay close to me!

00:09:38.063 --> 00:09:40.521
- HUGO: They ate him, Amicia! They ate him!

00:09:40.578 --> 00:09:44.304
- AMICIA: But where did they come from?
How can there be so many of them?

00:09:44.344 --> 00:09:45.234
Protect us.

00:09:45.313 --> 00:09:46.484
- HUGO: They're everywhere!

00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.656
- AMICIA: The light! They're scared of the light!

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:55.921
It's a nightmare.

00:09:55.984 --> 00:09:58.271
- HUGO: We have to get back outside, Amicia!

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:00.671
- AMICIA: I know! Keep moving!

00:10:03.641 --> 00:10:06.021
It's... a monk... The other brother...

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:09.188
We going to have to climb up.
I'll have to put the torch down.

00:10:09.282 --> 00:10:10.531
- HUGO: No, please.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.641
- AMICIA: Calm down. There's a torch holder.
We'll still have light.

00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:14.788
- HUGO: But then what?

00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:16.438
- AMICIA: We'll find something.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.422
I don't understand why there are so many of them.

00:10:29.891 --> 00:10:31.971
Fire. We need some fire.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:34.704
The wood will burn quickly.
We have to hurry.

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:39.125
- HUGO: Go away! Shoo!
GO AWAY!

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:42.238
- AMICIA: Calm down, Hugo!
The light will protect us, alright?

00:10:42.282 --> 00:10:43.562
- HUGO: Alright.

00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:50.388
- AMICIA: So that's their plague... Rats...

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:53.376
The priest spoke of a way out,
through the crypt.

00:10:58.626 --> 00:11:00.703
- HUGO: Amicia, the three statues.
(GROUND BREAKING)

- AMICIA: The Crypt of the Three Saints!

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.607
It's the exit the Father spoke of.

00:11:04.737 --> 00:11:06.704
We have to find another way.

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:25.974
Come on. I'll help you.

00:11:26.066 --> 00:11:26.834

We can't do anything for them now.

How can we... What are we going to do?

00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:51.782
That... That seems to keep them busy.

00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:52.797
- HUGO: Are you sure?

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.529

Alright. Let be careful.

Can you get the torch?

How am I going to get back?

00:15:42.198 --> 00:15:43.954
- AMICIA: We'll find a way. Don't worry.

00:15:44.047 --> 00:15:45.974

00:15:47.784 --> 00:15:50.338
- AMICIA: We'll... move together...

00:15:50.493 --> 00:15:53.871
That way the light coming through the grating
will protect me too.

Ready?

Very good.

Do you want the torch?

00:16:11.248 --> 00:16:13.683
- AMICIA: Yes. There are too many rats on my side.

00:16:13.852 --> 00:16:15.037
- HUGO: But where can I get through?

00:16:15.193 --> 00:16:16.678
- AMICIA: The hole behind you.

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:18.566
That's the only way I can see.

00:16:18.735 --> 00:16:20.904
Go through there and I'll meet you on the other side.

00:16:20.987 --> 00:16:21.966

I'll be with you very quickly.

00:16:25.232 --> 00:16:27.055
- HUGO: Alright. But please hurry.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.288

00:17:08.748 --> 00:17:10.954
- AMICIA: Hugo! What's going on?

00:17:12.146 --> 00:17:14.060
Hugo! Talk to me!

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:17.537
Come on, come on!

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:54.454

00:17:55.024 --> 00:17:56.665

00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:59.204
- HUGO: There were rats.
I ran to the light.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.467
- AMICIA: Did they bite you?

00:18:00.701 --> 00:18:04.047

But there rats down there.

00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:05.571
- AMICIA: I'll open a way through for you.

00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:07.524
We're going to get you down from there.

00:18:09.542 --> 00:18:14.203
Calm down, Amicia.
He's fine. You're fine. Stay focused.

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:31.054
These twigs burn too quickly.

00:18:31.274 --> 00:18:33.448
I won't be able to keep them back long enough.

00:18:33.461 --> 00:18:35.479

00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:43.354

Ready. You can come down now.

00:19:10.545 --> 00:19:13.938
Sorry, I shouldn't have left you alone.
It's too risky.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.063
- HUGO: That's alright.

00:19:58.878 --> 00:20:01.821
Oh, thank you.
We can get out of here now.

00:20:01.964 --> 00:20:03.644

- HUGO: Should we go anyway?

00:20:35.948 --> 00:20:38.504
- AMICIA: Yes. We managed to get this far.

00:20:38.722 --> 00:20:40.961
We'll be fine.
Just stay close.

00:20:59.855 --> 00:21:02.432
- AMICIA: Yes. We're... We're in their nest.

00:21:02.654 --> 00:21:05.654

Leave us alone!
