WEBVTT 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: (panting)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Look, Amicia.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm coming...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Wow...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Why are there candles?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The candles are... to show that you're thinking of someone.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Oh. Can I light one?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: If you want to. Don't burn yourself.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Thank you!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
For Mummy and Daddy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Watch over them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: It's funny. The sound here...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: There's an echo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Hello!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, there might be people here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Oh.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Forgive me for... the evil I have just committed... I never...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia, you're really squeezing me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Sorry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Hey, look!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There's a broken window and a ladder.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Could be our way out.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Climb up!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I hope it doesn't break like the other one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It won't, Hugo. Trust me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia, there's someone there!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Monk: Children, what are you doing here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Father! We need help!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Monk: Leave! It's dangerous! You have no business being here!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Wait! Please! It's important!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We should go and talk to him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Is he the one who knows where Laurentius is?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It has to be him... It has to...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Oh, they've broken everything.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: What's going on here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Perhaps they're building bigger beds?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I don't think that's it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I know that smell.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Medicinal herbs...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The monks must have put them in the water to purify themselves.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Mother used to do the same.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Flowers! They're so pretty!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They're carnations. We had some in my herbarium.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But those ones are prettier.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, we have to keep moving.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Wait, wait. Come here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: What?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: It will protect you. And it's pretty, too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Oh, alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Now we can go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Thank you, Hugo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: You're welcome.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Father?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Monk: You again! I told you to leave!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Just a moment! Just a...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Monk: You have no idea!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Leave while you still can!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Please! Someone has to help us! Do it for him at least.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Monk: The Robert de Rune coat of arms.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We are his children. We are looking for Laurentius...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
..., the doctor,...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...Do you know him?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Monk: Yes, yes, I know him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I know he used to look after your family.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
He spoke of you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I am Father Thomas.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Your presence here is not a good sign.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The Inquisition. They came and they...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Father Thomas: I can imagine. But what is happening here is far worse.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You must leave immediately, or you will die.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: But Father, the villagers wanted to kill us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Father Thomas: They're mad, they're mad... I...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Laurentius... Laurentius... No...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I cannot leave the church... But an exit...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...through the Crypt of the Three Saints! It may not be too late.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I shall try and put you on the path to Laurentius' farm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But after that... may God watch over you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
All seems calme for the moment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Above all, be sure to stay in the light.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Father, why are there crosses on the village doors?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Is it really the plague?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Father Thomas: It started with bites, during the night.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Then the sickness spread, first in families.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Then to everyone. Fever, boils. People started dying.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And when we finally found out where it came from...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...it was already too late.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: And... where did it come from?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Father Thomas: We're nearly there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Brother Morel should be here. We are the last two remaining.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Brother Morel?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Stay here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Brother Morel?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Brother!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(high pitch noise)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: What is the matter?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Father?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(ground shaking)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(wind sound)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: No no no!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(music intensifies)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Father Thomas: Ah! No!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Quick! The light!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Father, NO!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Father Thomas: THE LIGHT!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(flesh eating sound)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Oh my God! Hugo, stay close to me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: They ate him, Amicia! They ate him!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: But where did they come from? How can there be so many of them?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Protect us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: They're everywhere!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The light! They're scared of the light!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's a nightmare.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: We have to get back outside, Amicia!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I know! Keep moving!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's... a monk... The other brother...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We going to have to climb up. I'll have to put the torch down.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: No, please.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Calm down. There's a torch holder. We'll still have light.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But then what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We'll find something.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'll give you a hand.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(ground shaking)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I don't understand why there are so many of them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Fire. We need some fire.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The wood will burn quickly. We have to hurry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Go away! Shoo! GO AWAY!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Calm down, Hugo! The light will protect us, alright?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: So that's their plague... Rats...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The priest spoke of a way out, through the crypt.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia, the three statues.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(ground breaking)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The Crypt of the Three Saints!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It's the exit the Father spoke of.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We have to find another way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Go on. Climb up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Uh huhm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They've eaten them all.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Try not to look. We can't do anything for them now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: It's horrible!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I know. Come on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You go first.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(rats squeaking)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ah!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Right. We'll pass at the same time!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'll go first.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They're making too much noise... Too much noise...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, calm down.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No rats.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(rats breaking through)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh no... No!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: The light! Into the light, quick!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I don't see any torches. How can we... What are we going to do?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That... That seems to keep them busy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Are you sure?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Another ham should be enough.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Down there! The Three Saints!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Alright. Let be careful.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(rats squeaking)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We'll be safer if we go that way.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Don't fall. Don't fall.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We won't fall. Hold my hand tight.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The torch.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: There's a hole in the grating.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I'll lift this up. Can you get the torch?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It's heavy! Hugo! Hurry up! Come on!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh no!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Are you alright?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Yes. Stay where you are, the ground is rotten.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia, How... How am I going to get back?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We'll find a way. Don't worry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
As long as you have the torch, you'll be safe.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But... What about you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We'll... move together...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That way the light coming through the grating will protect me too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ready?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Ready.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Here we go then. Slowly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Very good.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Look, there's a hole. Do you want the torch?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Yes. There are too many rats on my side.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But where can I get through?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The hole behind you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's the only way I can see.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Go through there and I'll meet you on the other side.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Are you sure?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Just stop if you see rats. I'll be with you very quickly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Alright. But please hurry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Quick now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(collapsing sound)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: (screamming) Amicia! Amicia! Come quickly!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo! What's going on?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo! Talk to me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come on, come on!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia, up here!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, are you alright?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: There were rats. I ran to the light.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Did they bite you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: No. I found a ladder. But there rats down there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I'll open a way through for you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We're going to get you down from there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Calm down, Amicia. He's fine. You're fine. Stay focused.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
These twigs burn too quickly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I won't be able to keep them back long enough.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Wait. I have something for you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Perfect! Thank you!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ready. You can come down now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Sorry, I shouldn't have left you alone. It's too risky.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: That's alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The crypt!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh, thank you. We can get out of here now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Yes. Far, far away!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Go ahead. I'll be right behind you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Of course.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Oh, what's that on the ground?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Should we go anyway?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Yes. We managed to get this far.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We'll be fine. Just stay close.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: What's that stuff in the walls?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I... I... I don't know.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They did that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: You... you think so?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Yes. We're... We're in their nest.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: So... They're going to be... even more angry?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia, we mustn't touch the walls.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The air. It's burning my throat.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Over there! Light! We're there! We're there, Hugo!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(ground shaking)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No! Run, Hugo! RUN!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Go away! Leave us alone!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We did it. We did it. We did it. We...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia... I want to see Mummy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't want her to be dead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I want her to come back.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(emotional music)
