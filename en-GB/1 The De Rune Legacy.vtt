- BÉATRICE: We have to get further away.

00:23:45.604 --> 00:23:47.953
- AMICIA: If I can hit the helmets in the crate over there...

00:23:48.144 --> 00:23:49.671
- BÉATRICE: Your sling will give us away.

00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:52.046

- SOLDIER: He's the Grand Inquisitor's right hand.

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:21.349
The guard has never had a better captain.

00:24:21.565 --> 00:24:22.517
- SOLDIER: Good.

00:24:22.645 --> 00:24:24.445
At least he got the father.

00:24:27.071 --> 00:24:27.911
Why?

00:24:28.023 --> 00:24:29.435
What did they want from him?

00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:30.973
- BÉATRICE: I'll explain later.

00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:33.349

00:24:52.118 --> 00:24:52.816
- AMICIA: Mother?

00:24:52.927 --> 00:24:55.308
- BÉATRICE: Maybe by throwing one of these pots.

00:24:55.356 --> 00:24:56.276
- AMICIA: Really?

00:24:56.356 --> 00:24:57.689
- BÉATRICE: The noise will attract him.

00:24:57.832 --> 00:24:59.403
We'll just get past behind his back.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.050
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:09.418
- SOLDIER: That noise...

00:25:09.688 --> 00:25:11.422
Better go see what it was.

00:25:12.482 --> 00:25:14.082

- BÉATRICE: Stay calmed.

00:25:19.653 --> 00:25:21.586
- AMICIA: Hold my hand tight.

00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:27.978
- BÉATRICE: It's locked from the other side.

00:25:28.248 --> 00:25:29.200
- AMICIA: Mother...

00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:30.772

- BÉATRICE: Yes.

00:25:31.883 --> 00:25:32.645
Hugo.

00:25:32.724 --> 00:25:37.740
I'm sorry. I know you're scared but if you get through there you could open the door for us.

00:25:37.804 --> 00:25:40.074
You're the only one who can do it.

00:25:40.201 --> 00:25:41.380
- HUGO: But what's behind there?

00:25:41.524 --> 00:25:43.237
- BÉATRICE: Just concentrate on the door.

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:46.174
You're a brave boy, you prove it to me everyday.

00:25:46.283 --> 00:25:48.536
Amicia is going to let go of your hand...

00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:50.632
...Then you can quickly go through, alright?

00:26:48.634 --> 00:26:49.638
- BÉATRICE: An attack.

00:26:49.824 --> 00:26:51.354
Listen to my voice, Hugo.

00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:52.588

- BÉATRICE: Listen to me... Breathe...

00:26:57.517 --> 00:27:00.671
Think of the cloud that you breathe in and blow out.

00:27:00.877 --> 00:27:02.671
In... out...

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:07.702
- Like that... slowly...
- AMICIA: Mother, we can't stayy here!

00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:09.183
- BÉATRICE: Give him a little time.

00:27:09.395 --> 00:27:10.671
Are you alright, Hugo?

00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:12.371

- BÉATRICE: (WHISPERING) It's too risky with Hugo.

00:27:41.921 --> 00:27:43.171
(WHISPERING) He's slower than us.

00:27:43.217 --> 00:27:46.504
- AMICIA: (WHISPERING) There are pots over there.
I could cross, make a diversion.

00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:47.504
- BÉATRICE: Alone?

00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:49.804
- AMICIA: Yes... You'd have more time.

00:27:51.933 --> 00:27:53.759
I can let you know when it's alright.

00:27:53.917 --> 00:27:55.372

00:28:19.685 --> 00:28:22.418

- AMICIA: I need to call them now.

I used to practise firing at it.

00:28:50.398 --> 00:28:51.959

00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:54.538
