00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I - THE DE RUNE LEGACY

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
KINGDOM OF FRANCE

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:24.000
- NOVEMBER 1348
- ROBERT: You are dawdling Amicia!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How will you be able to follow the lords at hunt?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
- AMICIA: (chuckles) Is that your only ambition for me? To follow?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I will beat them and I will watch them eat my dirt as I forge ahead!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But for that, I shall need a good horse.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
- ROBERT: You've been going on about for this walk for ages... Why here?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
- AMICIA: The tree!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
- ROBERT: Which tree?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
- AMICIA: The APPLE tree, father. I want to take the Knight's challange once more!

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.000
- ROBERT: The Knight's challenge... But you're not ten years old anymore. You know...
Robert:
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.000
- AMICIA: Oh please Father! I've trained hard for this!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
- ROBERT: All right, let's go!

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.000
- AMICIA: Look at Lion! The Guvenne beast is in a hurry to fight it out!
- (Lion barking)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
- ROBERT: (laughters) Your beast thinks with its stomach, as usual...

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000
- AMICIA: Well there's something you both have in common!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
- ROBERT: (chuckles) That's harsh...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
(Lion barking)

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
- AMICIA: Go on boy! You'll find a prey! I believe in you!

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.000
- ROBERT: Don't get your hopes up... Let's keep going...
- (Lion barking in the background)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Look... Your mother's ribbon is still here!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.000
This is where I courted her, you know...

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
- AMICIA: Yes Father... I know... If only she could come with us...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
- ROBERT: We all have obligations. Amicia. You...

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.000
- (Lion barking playfully in the background)
- You know, in a family...

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.000
Hey! I'm trying to tell her something!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
- AMICIA: (chuckles) Such authority, Knight De Rune!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
- ROBERT: Go! And bring something back for once!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Right. As I was saying... We all have obligations.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I have to manager these lands.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Your mother has to take care of your brother, and you...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.694
- AMICIA: And I hardly ever see you! I see Mother even less...

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:46.784
- ROBERT: Listen... We are here for you now, so...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Follow me, daughter!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
- AMICIA: Hey! Wait! (laughters)

00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:52.821
- ROBERT: I hope you have your sling!

00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:54.038
- AMICIA: Of course!

00:02:57.508 --> 00:02:59.704
- ROBERT: Come on then!

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:05.121
Do you dare to enter the Trial's gate?

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.104
- AMICIA: Amicia de Rune fears nothing!

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.004
- ROBERT: This apple tree was planted when you were born...

00:03:10.053 --> 00:03:11.546
It will prove your worth!

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:14.288
- AMICIA: Sir Knight! What are the terms of the test?

00:03:14.288 --> 00:03:22.054
- ROBERT: The Sacred Apples of The... er... Sacred Apple Tree have been corrupted by a Great Evil!

00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:27.138
If you destroy six of these rotten apples by the time I count to ten...

00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:29.271
I will make you a Knight.

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:31.204
- AMICIA: I accept your challenge!

00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:36.604
- ROBERT: I can see some stones near the trunk over there. Go and get them, and tell me when you're ready.

00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:44.538
- AMICIA: Ready! I'll show you I'm not a child anymore...

00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:49.604
- ROBERT: All right, come back! Stand behind this trunk. You'll shoot from here.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.354
- AMICIA: It shall be done!

00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.388
- ROBERT: So here we go!

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:58.671
One

00:03:58.988 --> 00:03:59.559
Two

00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:01.448
Three

00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:02.718
Four

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.861
Five. Come on, Amicia!

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:07.162
Six

00:04:07.892 --> 00:04:08.804
Seven

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.754
- ROBERT: Eight
- AMICIA: And this is how Amicia becomes a true knight!

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:14.130
- ROBERT: Nine

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.686
- AMICIA: There!

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:18.571
- ROBERT: Well well... I must say I'm impressed!...

00:04:18.922 --> 00:04:21.188
But your sling is frightfully noisy...

00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:23.754
- AMICIA: It was a present... from you...

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:26.988
- ROBERT: Oh yes... I'd quite forgotten.

00:04:27.747 --> 00:04:29.620
- (Lion barking)
- Goodness... What's up with him?

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.557
- AMICIA: He must have smelled a rabbit. Come on, quickly!

00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:37.700
- ROBERT: You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.154
You are much faster than I am.

00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:50.674
- AMICIA: Lion! Wait for me!

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:03.404
Lion! A hunting dog... is not supposed to lose its hunter!

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.004
Lion! Where did he go?

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:13.364
Ah! There you are!

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.692
What did you smell?

00:05:18.168 --> 00:05:21.882
Oh gosh! A wild boar! What a good dog!

00:05:23.287 --> 00:05:26.763
- ROBERT: Amicia! Did he find something?

00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:29.004
- AMICIA: Shhh... Come and see!

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.260
A wild boar!

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.911
- ROBERT: Some game... This will do nicely for a little feast.

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:35.388
- AMICIA: I could use my sling!

00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:38.911
- ROBERT: That might work... but you'll need to get closer.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:42.740
This grass will keep you hidden if you stay low.

00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:48.315
- AMICIA: It's drinking. Time to make my move.

00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:56.121
- Oh no, it saw me!
- ROBERT: Find a way to sneak up! You have to hit the head.

00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:02.410
Careful! You have to aim for the head.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.671
- AMICIA: I'm doing my best. I want that feast!

00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:08.937
- ROBERT: I know. You can do it, my darling.

00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:23.754
- ROBERT: Does hunger always make you this accurate?

00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:24.893
- AMICIA: Huh...

00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:29.104
- ROBERT: But the feast isn't on your plate quite yet!

00:06:29.104 --> 00:06:32.521
- AMICIA: Oh no! No no no! Go Lion, don't lose the scent!

00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.088
I promise you, tonight, we shall dine like kings!

00:06:44.248 --> 00:06:46.838
- ROBERT: I have no doubt we will!

00:06:47.818 --> 00:06:48.988
- AMICIA: Don't give up, Lion!

00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:53.604
I'm coming, Lion! Keep him there and you'll get a piece for yourself!

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:56.488
The boar... It's bleeding...

00:07:02.368 --> 00:07:05.888
He's stop barking... He must have found it...

00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:10.972
Argh! These breeches were almost new...

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:13.539
Someone's not going to be happy...

00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:22.189
The trees... What did that?

00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:25.576
Lion! Come here!

00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:31.687
It's... It's the boar... But how...?

00:07:32.428 --> 00:07:34.359
Lion couldn't have done that...

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:39.291
Lion! Come here! Lion!

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.471
Lion! I'm here! I'm coming!

00:07:56.698 --> 00:08:00.088
My dog... Who... Who did this?

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:11.354
No! Lion! No!

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.682
- ROBERT: What devilry is this?

00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:16.371
We must go... immediately!

00:08:18.947 --> 00:08:27.538
TITLE: A PLAGUE TALE - INNOCENCE

00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:40.788
- ROBERT: I shall organise a hunt.

00:08:41.018 --> 00:08:44.421
Go and find your mother, tell her I must speak with her.

00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:45.338
She's probably...

00:08:45.338 --> 00:08:48.671
- AMICIA: ...looking after Hugo. Yes. Of course.

00:08:51.812 --> 00:08:52.658
- ROBERT: Amicia.

00:08:55.224 --> 00:08:56.838
He was a good dog.

00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:04.801
- SERVANT 1: Where are the rivers for reinforcing the door?

00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.771
- SERVANT 2: I haven't been able to make them yet.

00:09:06.872 --> 00:09:10.404
- SERVANT 1: Did you hear about the English troops arriving?
- SERVANT 2: Erg...

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:06.554
- FLORE: Oh! Lady Amicia! Did you have a good walk?

00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:11.738
- AMICIA: Later, Flore... Tell the others that the forest is out of bounds until further notice.

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:15.088
- FLORE: Er... yes. I'll... I'll tell them.

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:43.520
- AMICIA: Take care of Lion, please... He deserves his place at your side...

00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:50.404
...even if he was a bit naughty sometimes... Goodbye my darling dog...

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.638
I hope mother's not too busy.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.302
- SERVANT 3: This sunshine won't last long...

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.423
The rain has already ruined the harvest.

00:12:10.662 --> 00:12:12.554
People are dying of hunger.

00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:17.355
We're lucky to be in this house... mark my word...
(GOOSE AGREES)

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.995
- SERVANT 3: You're right about that!

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.211
- AMICIA: Ah! Gabrielle... Is mother upstairs?

00:12:27.475 --> 00:12:29.142
- GABRIELLE: Yes, she spent the night there.

00:12:29.354 --> 00:12:31.629
The little one had another one of his attacks.

00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:34.989
- AMICIA: She won't be in a good mood...

00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:18.720
- SERVANT 4: Did you hear what happened at the village?

00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:20.360
- SERVANT 5: People being bitten? Kids, too. Can you imagine?

00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:24.854
- SERVANT 4: Each time it happens at night.

00:13:25.228 --> 00:13:29.460
- SERVANT 5: Famine, war on our doorstep, and now vampires...

00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:32.688
- SERVANT 4: We must have sinned something rotten to be punished so...

00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:36.048
Oh! Lady Amicia! Hello! I didn't see you there...

00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:37.794
- SERVANT 5: Yes, hello, milady!

00:13:37.873 --> 00:13:38.587
- AMICIA: Hello!

00:14:20.686 --> 00:14:22.618
- SERVANT 6: (harmonising)

00:14:22.803 --> 00:14:26.638
- AMICIA: (smells) The smell of your cooking warms the heart...

00:14:26.903 --> 00:14:29.604
- SERVANT 6: Oh, it's nothing much, but I think you'll like it.

00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:30.766
- AMICIA: I'm sure I will.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.821
- LOUISE: Yes, Lady Béatrice, leave it to me.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.965
- AMICIA: Louise, have you been seen mother?

00:15:10.123 --> 00:15:13.438
- LOUISE: Indeed. Erm, do you... Do you  want to see her?

00:15:13.644 --> 00:15:16.071
- AMICIA: It's important. Father's orders.

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:19.094
- LOUISE: Oh, in that case... I have to finish your room.

00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:21.687
By the way, I've left a little something for you on your bed.

00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:23.062
Come and see if you'd like.

00:15:23.195 --> 00:15:24.782
- AMICIA: Ah, thank you.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.501
Mother?

00:16:33.533 --> 00:16:35.454
- BÉATRICE: You know you are not supposed to be here...

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:39.788
- AMICIA: I know, but... something attacked Lion in the forest!

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:49.788
- BÉATRICE: My dear, I really wish I had the time to listen to your adventures but...
(HORSESHOES NOISES IN THE BACKGROUND)

00:16:53.161 --> 00:16:56.150
- AMICIA: But it's true! Lion was lying there on the ground...

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.138
...and then he was...

00:16:57.208 --> 00:17:00.254
- BÉATRICE: Shhh... You are to stay here with your brother.

00:17:06.354 --> 00:17:06.354
- AMICIA: What? Why? What's happening?
- BÉATRICE: Close the door behind me and do not open the shutters...

00:17:06.354 --> 00:17:07.521
...whatever happens.

00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:09.138
- AMICIA: But... Hugo...

00:17:09.219 --> 00:17:14.138
- BÉATRICE: He is not contagious. I realise you hardly know him...

00:17:14.219 --> 00:17:17.188
...but he will be alright. Trust me, Amicia.

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:19.438
- AMICIA: Yes, Mother.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.988
All these potions... Mother...

00:17:46.381 --> 00:17:48.709
- Will you ever be able to cure him?
- HUGO: Mummy?

00:17:54.488 --> 00:17:58.738
- AMICIA: How long has he been here? Four years? Five?
- HUGO: Mummy, are you there?

00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:02.663
- AMICIA: Where is he? Hugo?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- HUGO: Come and see.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.731
- AMICIA: (hesistating) It's me

00:18:13.207 --> 00:18:15.604
Your sister... Amicia...

00:18:17.188 --> 00:18:17.942
- HUGO: Hello.

00:18:18.286 --> 00:18:20.604
- AMICIA: We haven't seen each other much...

00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:23.654
- Mummy will be back soon.
- SOLDIER: Move! Come one!

00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:33.376
- NICHOLAS: Did he talk?

00:18:35.598 --> 00:18:36.821
- SOLDIER 1: No, Lord Nicholas.

00:18:38.038 --> 00:18:39.538
- SOLDIER 2: He killed two of our men.

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:44.004
- NICHOLAS: Where is he?

00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:50.804
I won't ask again... Where is your son?

00:18:51.154 --> 00:18:53.171
- ROBERT: In good hands.

00:18:55.736 --> 00:18:58.646
- AMICIA: (breathe heavily in shock)

00:18:59.016 --> 00:19:00.171
- NICHOLAS: Search the house!

00:19:01.582 --> 00:19:07.217
