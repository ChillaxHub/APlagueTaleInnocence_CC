00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.297
XI - ALIVE

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:39.238
(CHILLING MUSIC PLAYING)

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:41.211
- HUGO: Look! It's her!

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:50.175
Amicia!

00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:56.601
- LUCAS: So you succeeded?
- RODRIC: Here!

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:59.436
I have to warn you, smells a bit burnt.

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.946
- HUGO: Who's he?

00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:04.296
- RODRIC: Rodric.
But... Shhh...

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:05.371
- LUCAS: Ah...

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.950
The Sanguinis Itinera...
- HUGO: What is this book about?

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:12.823
- LUCAS: It's...

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.617
- AMICIA: It's a story of a little boy...
Who's going to get a lot better now.

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:20.895
- RODRIC: (CLAPS) Right, I'm starving. Anyone else?
- HUGO: Me!

00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:24.372
- AMICIA: Come and eat then.
I think we deserve it.

00:01:26.348 --> 00:01:28.028
You too.
- LUCAS: Coming.

00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:40.839
(HAMMER HITTING ANVIL)

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:58.613
(HAMMER HITTING ANVIL)

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.285
- RODRIC: No no no!
Bloody hell! That's no good.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.121
- AMICIA: Hey, are you alright?

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:05.859
- RODRIC: It's nothing.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520
Tell me...

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.661
This door...

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:11.285
Have you opened it before?

00:02:11.317 --> 00:02:12.639
- AMICIA: It's stuck.

00:02:12.692 --> 00:02:15.139
It's the only place in the château
we haven't been yet.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.040
- RODRIC: Don't you want to see
what's behind it?

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:19.306
- AMICIA: Well... Hugo is asleep.

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:24.991
It's not an Inquisition guard.

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:28.263
But at least, I'll be able to continue training.

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.641
We see everything...

00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:35.227
And no one sees us.

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:38.754
The world is forgotten in this castle.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.175
Come on. Rodric is waiting for me.

00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:24.280
Let's go take a look.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.030
- RODRIC: This, at least,
I know... how to do it...

00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.366
There you go.
- AMICIA: Wow, that was...

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:33.524
...efficient.

00:03:33.564 --> 00:03:35.348
- RODRIC: And almost painless.

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:37.236
Come on.
Let's go.

00:03:37.431 --> 00:03:38.431
Woah...

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:39.944
Can you feel that?

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.337
- AMICIA: No, what?

00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:45.256
- RODRIC: When you're in a place
that'd been abandoned for a long time.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:46.754
There's something in the air.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.342
- AMICIA: Yes... Dust.

00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:50.101
- RODRIC: No, the stones.

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:53.173
It's like... interrupting a conversation.

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:53.850
- AMICIA: Ah...

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:57.180
- RODRIC: This is the first time I've felt it here.

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:02.027
Hm...
That looks dangerous.

00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.644
Let's avoid it for now.
Another door.

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:06.215
Shall we continue?

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.033
- AMICIA: Of course.
- RODRIC: Let's see...

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.533
Where this... leads us...

00:04:11.637 --> 00:04:12.637
Oh...

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:13.746
The courtyard.

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.532
- AMICIA: It's a shortcut.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.395
- RODRIC: I almost forgot.

00:04:23.447 --> 00:04:25.908
I found something while I was doing
some clearing earlier.

00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:26.923
Come take a look.

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:28.772
- AMICIA: Another story about stones?

00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:31.399
- RODRIC: Actually, you're not far off.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.561
Amicia... Come and see this.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.040
You'll like it.
- AMICIA: I'm coming.

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:09.046
A fresco.

00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:10.595
It's...

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:12.302
...strangely familiar.

00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:14.775
- RODRIC: It includes the symbols of the pillars.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.066
This castle has things to tell us, huh?

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:19.332
- AMICIA: And... what is it telling us then?

00:05:19.372 --> 00:05:21.728
- RODRIC: Even I don't understand everything.

00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:23.927
I just think we'll be fine here.

00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:25.413
- LUCAS: Amicia!

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.522
Come quickly!
It's Hugo!

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:28.603
- AMICIA: Oh no!

00:05:28.668 --> 00:05:29.668
I'm coming!

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:30.491
- RODRIC: Need me?

00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:32.249
- AMICIA: Uh... I-I'll call you.

00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:33.968
- LUCAS: Come on.
Come on!

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:43.539
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

00:05:44.607 --> 00:05:46.341
- AMICIA: I'm here, Lucas.

00:05:46.508 --> 00:05:49.542
- LUCAS: Quickly.
- AMICIA: Hugo... please...

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:56.729
- LUCAS: It's getting worse and worse.

00:05:56.782 --> 00:06:01.443
- AMICIA: The Macula is progressing too fast.
- LUCAS: I realise that, Amicia. I'm doing my best.

00:06:01.482 --> 00:06:02.081
I...

00:06:02.172 --> 00:06:04.294
I mean I'm trying to do what the book says...

00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:06.325
But... it's going to take too long.

00:06:06.378 --> 00:06:08.178
I need a proper laboratory.

00:06:08.253 --> 00:06:09.672
- AMICIA: Like Laurentius had?

00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:10.935
- LUCAS: No, no!

00:06:10.974 --> 00:06:13.851
One with better equipment.
- AMICIA: Well... perhaps my Mother...

00:06:13.904 --> 00:06:15.184
At-at my home...

00:06:16.274 --> 00:06:18.747
- LUCAS: She must have some equipment there.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.800
You're right.
It's worth a try.

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:44.229
- RODRIC: I believe your twins are back.

00:06:44.282 --> 00:06:45.232
- AMICIA: Mélie!

00:06:45.284 --> 00:06:46.404
You found him!

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:49.268
- ARTHUR: More... dead than alive.

00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:52.094
I guess...
- MÉLIE: Amicia, we-we came because...

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.473
Well...
- ARTHUR: Yes...

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:54.815
- MÉLIE: Arthur, you tell her.

00:06:54.868 --> 00:06:58.422
- ARTHUR: After our little adventure
with your heretic-burning friends...

00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:00.728
I ended up in an Inquisition cell.

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.531
One day, I saw a guard accompany a prisoner
who looked the worse for wear...

00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.411
Those... bastards wanted her to tell them where her son was, so...

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.197
They threatened her.

00:07:12.693 --> 00:07:14.373
And I heard her name.

00:07:15.623 --> 00:07:18.423
Béatrice de Rune.
- AMICIA: Mother is alive?

00:07:18.553 --> 00:07:19.553
She's alive?

00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:22.003
You managed to get Arthur out...

00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:23.943
- MÉLIE: It wasn't simple.
Believe me.

00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:24.854
- AMICIA: So you could...

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:27.406
- ARTHUR: Forget it.
I was nothing.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680
She...

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:31.869
She's too important to the Grand Inquisitor.

00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:33.954
He... uhh...

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.253
...<i>"questions"</i> her...

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:39.750
...a lot.
- AMICIA: They...

00:07:40.245 --> 00:07:41.456
...tortured her?

00:07:41.547 --> 00:07:44.932
Hugo mustn't know anything of this.
- LUCAS: Even that she's alive?

00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:46.451
It might help him.

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.398
- AMICIA: And what will we say
when he wants to see her?

00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:51.338
Tell him <i>nothing</i>, alright?

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.630
- HUGO: (SCREAMING)

00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.263
- AMICIA: Oh no!
Hugo!

00:07:57.433 --> 00:07:58.433
Hugo!

00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:00.297
- HUGO: (GROANING)

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:04.802
- LUCAS: The next threshold. It's coming!
- AMICIA: We have to go at once. To my home!

00:08:04.894 --> 00:08:06.169
Now!
- MÉLIE: You go.

00:08:06.248 --> 00:08:09.932
We'll stay here with him.
- AMICIA: It will be alright, my little brother.

00:08:09.998 --> 00:08:10.998
I swear.

00:08:11.092 --> 00:08:12.706
This time we <i>will</i> heal you.

00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.492
- LUCAS: Alright... I'll get the Sanguinis Itinera.

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:18.078
And some potions and then we'll leave.
