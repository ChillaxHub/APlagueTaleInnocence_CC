00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.047
XVII - FOR EACH OTHER

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.031
- AMICIA: Alright, let's go.

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:34.562
- HUGO: Have you got everything?

00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:36.968
- AMICIA: Yes. That's all Lucas asked for.

00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:39.140
- HUGO: Is Mummy going to get better with this?

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:42.656
- AMICIA: She will be alright, Hugo.
Mummy is tough, isn't she? Just like you.

00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:44.390
- HUGO: That's right.

00:00:44.453 --> 00:00:46.578
I can't wait for us to find a new castle.

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:49.858
- AMICIA: Well... (LAUGHS)
You've got a taste of a king now.

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:53.682
We'll see what we can do.
We have to leave the region first.

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:07.906
- VILLAGER 1: So, will you be able to go home?

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.718
- VILLAGER 2: Yes, the nest is still there,
but it's empty.

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:14.718
- VILLAGER 1: (SIGHS)
I can't believe the rats are gone for good.

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:17.064
- VILLAGER 2: Let's hope they are.

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:23.468
- HUGO: Oh, Amicia, look!
- MAN: Hello, young man!

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.359
You're gonna try your hands at shooting?

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:28.958
- HUGO: Not me. My sister is really good.
Right, Amicia?

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:32.422
- AMICIA: Alright, let's have a go.

00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:34.116
- MAN: Good, good.

00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:35.437
The rule is simple.

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:38.182
You have six stones, six possible shots.

00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:41.077
Try to shoot as many targets as possible.

00:01:41.422 --> 00:01:42.542
Are you ready?

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:44.562
- AMICIA: Ready.

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.289
- HUGO: Go on, Amicia.

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:51.187
(HAMMER HITTING ANVIL
IN THE BACKGROUND)

00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:59.921
Yes! (LAUGHS)

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:08.031
Wow...

00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:18.687
- MAN: (CLAPPING) Hey-y, you know how to do it

00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:19.843
You won an apple.

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:21.234
And all due respect.

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.015
- HUGO: (LAUGHS) Yes, Amicia.
- AMICIA: The apple is for you, Hugo.

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:25.578
You're my biggest supporter.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:26.906
- HUGO: Oh, thanks!

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:28.456
I was hungry.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.328
- AMICIA: As always.

00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:30.493
- MAN: Hey...

00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:33.500
Did they were celebrating
the third day without rats?

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:36.078
There's a little fair down the street.
Go take a look!

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.046
- HUGO: A fair! A real fair!

00:02:38.156 --> 00:02:39.750
I've never seen a fair before.

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:41.750
- AMICIA: Hugo, Lucas is waiting for us.

00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:42.984
We should be getting back.

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:45.353
- HUGO: But it's a fair. Come on!
- AMICIA: Hugo! (CHUCKLES)

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:47.900
Alright, but we can't stay long.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.744
- VILLAGER 1: We can rebuild the village.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:53.712
But there will still be empty houses.

00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:58.783
- VILLAGER 2: If <i>The Bite</i> leaves us in peace,
people will come back, eventually.

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:10.096
- MAN 1: So is it true?
You're going to deliver grain.

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.494
- MAN 2: It's been three days
since we've seen a rat.

00:03:12.557 --> 00:03:14.423
We have to get back to work.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.087
- MAN 1: It's true that we don't see anyone
in the view anymore.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.380
What a misery.

00:03:19.494 --> 00:03:21.014
- MAN 2: Precisely.

00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:24.759
The nobles, the lords,
do you think they'll get their hands dirty?

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:25.869
Never.

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:28.009
- MAN 1: But they do have money.

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:29.368
And if they want to eat...

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.806
...they'll have to pay us.

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:31.869
A lot more.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.666
- MAN 2: Hey... But you're right.

00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:36.353
- MAN 1: I'm telling you.
Everything was changed.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.884
The rats were a necessary evil.

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:55.650
- VILLAGER 1: Hey, look!
- VILLAGER 2: Oh...

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:58.619
- VILLAGER 1: That's the young boy.
- AMICIA: Oh no.

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:00.587
- MAN: No, no, boy.
You just can't come in.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.619
- HUGO: But why?

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.791
- MAN: Because you can't. That's why.

00:04:05.354 --> 00:04:06.931
- AMICIA: Hey, is there a problem?

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.384
- MAN: (SCOFFS) Look, the problem is
a kid and his sister are wanted around here.

00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:12.032
By important people.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.962
And we... (SOFT SIGHS) Well we...

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.056
We just don't want any trouble here.
You understand?

00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:17.962
- AMICIA: I can see very well.

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:19.594
Hugo, we have to go.

00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:24.634
- HUGO: But the fair...
- AMICIA: Come on.

00:04:37.948 --> 00:04:39.628
Hey, Hugo.
- HUGO: What?

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:43.322
- AMICIA: The first one to arrive
at the cart wins 20 apples.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.010
- HUGO: 20 apples?

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.057
- AMICIA: You'll never beat me.

00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:48.494
Right, slug?
- HUGO: What?

00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:50.459
You'll see.
- AMICIA: Oh yeah?

00:04:50.698 --> 00:04:51.818
Then on three.

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:53.323
One.

00:04:53.713 --> 00:04:54.400
Two.

00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:56.510
- HUGO: Three!
- AMICIA: Hey... (LAUGHS)

00:04:57.776 --> 00:05:01.275
(MAIN THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:03.003
I'm right behind you.

00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:06.058
- HUGO: You can't beat me.
(LAUGHS)

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.216
- AMICIA: Alright, alright.

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:13.291
You won.

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:16.713
- HUGO: Yes! 20 apples.

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:22.971
- AMICIA: We made it, Lucas.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:26.463
- LUCAS: Did you have everything?
...

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.432
- AMICIA: All of it. Let's go.

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.599
- LUCAS: Good.

00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:33.103
- HUGO: Amicia...

00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:33.932
- AMICIA: Yes?

00:05:33.963 --> 00:05:36.244
- HUGO: Why are they looking
at me like that?

00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:38.440
Mélie looked at me the same way.

00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:40.025
Then she left.

00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:42.150
Because she doesn't like me anymore.

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.909
- AMICIA: Hugo, she...

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.279
She has other things to do.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.557
- HUGO: That's not true.
It just doesn't matter.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.620
- LUCAS: (COMMANDS THE HORSES)

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.932
- AMICIA: Is she going to sleep much longer?

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:03.228
- LUCAS: She has to get her strength back.

00:06:03.448 --> 00:06:06.088
With the herbs you bought, she'll soon ...

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.606
- AMICIA: Alright.

00:06:17.104 --> 00:06:18.541
Hey, Hugo.

00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:19.613
- HUGO: What?

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:21.713
- AMICIA: Do you think I'm pretty?
- HUGO: (LAUGHS)

00:06:21.807 --> 00:06:24.119
You're ugly. Really ugly!

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:26.838
(LAUGHS)
- AMICIA: (GASPS) Ugly? Me?

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:29.650
- HUGO: You look like a big fat fly.

00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:34.510
- AMICIA: (GASPS) A fly? Your own sister?
Urhh... Such a slur-required punishment!

00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:45.135
(LAUGHTERS)

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:46.615
