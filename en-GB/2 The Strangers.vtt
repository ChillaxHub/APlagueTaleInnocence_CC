Rest now, you're safe. They'll never come looking for you here.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.932
You're soaking.

00:12:25.298 --> 00:12:28.306
There are clothes you can change into upstairs.

00:12:28.402 --> 00:12:30.438
in the chest in the bedroom.

00:12:30.664 --> 00:12:31.497
- AMICIA: Are...

00:12:31.775 --> 00:12:33.005
...Are you sure?

00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:34.850
Thank you!

00:12:35.108 --> 00:12:42.766
(FIRE CRACKLING)

00:12:50.777 --> 00:12:51.670
That's better.

00:12:52.186 --> 00:12:54.785
What about you?
- HUGO: We have to go and find Mummy, Amicia.

00:12:55.043 --> 00:12:56.075
- AMICIA: Not yet.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.357
She told us to find Laurentius.

00:12:58.704 --> 00:13:01.438
- HUGO: But that's silly! We're going to get caught.
- AMICIA: Hugo!

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:04.358
We're going to do what she told us, and that's it!

00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:05.877
Hugo, wait!

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:08.932

00:13:30.765 --> 00:13:31.761
- WOMAN: They fit you.

00:13:31.881 --> 00:13:32.476
Good.

00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:35.036
They belonged to my grandchildren.

00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:36.553
Oh...

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:39.301
M-My name is Clervie.
- AMICIA: I'm Amicia.

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:40.869
And this is Hugo.

00:13:41.345 --> 00:13:42.774
Say thank you, Hugo.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.008
- HUGO: Thank you.

00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:48.461
- AMICIA: Clervie, what is happening here?

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.026
- CLERVIE: The...

00:13:50.224 --> 00:13:51.514
...The plague...

00:13:51.814 --> 00:13:53.897
...So many people dead...

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.085
...and those still alive have...

00:13:58.057 --> 00:13:59.941
But where are your parents?

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.620
- HUGO: At home. They're waiting for us.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.774
- AMICIA: We're looking for a doctor, Laurentius.

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:14.921
- CLERVIE: A doctor... Perhaps... A man did come and help at the hospice early on...

00:14:15.036 --> 00:14:17.575
The monks might be able to tell you more, but...

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:18.270
- AMICIA: What?

00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:21.088
- CLERVIE: They haven't been seen recently.

00:14:21.484 --> 00:14:23.944
No one goes near the church anymore.

00:14:24.024 --> 00:14:27.271
- AMICIA: It's all we have. We must go and see.

00:14:27.357 --> 00:14:33.388
- CLERVIE: You'll die there. But no one listens to old Clervie anymore, so...

00:14:34.016 --> 00:14:37.221
Anyway, I see you have a sling.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.046
You're going to need it.

00:14:39.165 --> 00:14:41.725
But it'll be no use to you in that state.

00:14:41.903 --> 00:14:46.368
Go to the backyard, you'll find some new strips of leather there.

00:14:46.593 --> 00:14:51.638
And feel free to use the workshop in the next room for your repairs.

00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:53.200
- AMICIA: That's very kind of you.

00:14:57.047 --> 00:15:00.142
- CLERVIE: Feel free to use the tools by the workshop.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.823
- AMICIA: Right, got the tools, I just need the leather.

00:15:12.027 --> 00:15:14.924
Leather... Right, let's get to work.

00:15:15.953 --> 00:15:18.513
Come on, keep calm and concentrate.

00:15:21.095 --> 00:15:22.504
That's a lot better.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.432
With the right materials, I can improve it even more.

00:15:32.513 --> 00:15:35.073
Right, I must go and thank Clervie.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.060
- CLERVIE: Ah... so?

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:42.801
- AMICIA: It's a lot better.

00:15:43.436 --> 00:15:44.428
Thank you, Clervie.

00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:45.698
Thanks for everything.

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:49.804
- MAN 1: So that's where you lost them?

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.288
- MAN 2: Yeah, they won't survive long around here if you ask me.
- CLERVIE: Shhh...

00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:01.590
Put that mallet down! Are you stupid or what?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.218
- HUGO: I AM NOT STUPID!

00:16:04.388 --> 00:16:07.556
- CLERVIE: Children, that's enough noise!

00:16:07.298 --> 00:16:08.671
- HUGO: I want to see Mummy!

00:16:08.726 --> 00:16:11.204
- AMICIA: Shut up! You're going to get us killed!

00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:13.021
- HUGO: Mummy would protect us!

00:16:13.094 --> 00:16:14.185
- AMICIA: That's enough!

- HUGO: I... WANT... TO... SEE... MUMMY!

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.788
- AMICIA: MUMMY IS DEAD, HUGO!

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.638
You'll never see her again!

00:16:19.736 --> 00:16:20.529
Or Daddy!

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:22.414

You're lying...

00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:27.660

00:16:27.918 --> 00:16:29.822
Both of them, so shut up!
- HUGO: You're lying!

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.065

Hugo, wait! Don't go out, you're mad!

00:16:42.466 --> 00:16:44.153
Hugo, come back!
