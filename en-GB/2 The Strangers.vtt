00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:22.804
Amicia: The village must be further on.

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.888
Someone there should be able to help us find Laurentius.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:37.304
(pantings)

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:39.000
Hugo...

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:41.183
Hugo?

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:51.404
Hugo: Mummy won't be happy...

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:54.471
...when she finds out I felt in the water.

00:00:59.598 --> 00:01:01.397
Amicia: (holds back tears) Well...

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.104
Let's not mention it when we see her, alright?

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:06.318
Come on.

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.223
First we have to get dry.

00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:26.588
Hugo: Amicia, why did they want to capture us?

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:29.638
Amicia: I don't know... I don't want to think about it right now.

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:32.621
Hugo: We'll ask Laurentius to take us to see Mummy and Daddy.

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:33.623
Amicia: Yes...

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:35.157
...of course...

00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:44.020
Where is everyone?

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:50.727
Hugo: Oh! Apples!

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:52.340
Amicia: Hugo, not now!

00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:53.372
Hugo: But...

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.806
Amicia: Don't touch them! They're all rotten!

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:56.970
Hugo: But I'm hungry.

00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:58.954
Amicia: How can you think of food right now?

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:08.753
Smoke...

00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:19.124
Excuse me, please wait... Madame...

00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:21.743
What's the matter with them?

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:23.251
Hugo: They looked scared.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.054
Amicia: Excuse me, I'm the daughter of Lord Robert De Rune.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.021
We were attacked. We need help!

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.038
Hugo: Please, it's very cold!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Anybody there? I'm with my little brother.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The de Rune estate was attacked.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Hugo: Hello, Please, can you open the door? We're wet and hungry!
- Amicia: I'm begging you, please help us!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What on earth is going on?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I don't believe it!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: They're hiding.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Woman: We've waited too long... I told you, we need to leave.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: And go where? We'll lose everything!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Hugo: Someone's there.
- Woman: We'll come back later! When things are better.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: We'll all be dead before things get better 'ere!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's enough, I don't want to talk about it anymore!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Oh look, someone's drawn something on the door.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Come back here! That means that there are sick people in these houses!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Don't touch anything!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Oh... They're not allowed to go outside?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It's more serious than that!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It means that we could catch their illness, so stop running around!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Alright, sorry...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: The village is contaminated.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's why everyone's hiding.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I can smell something cooking! Is it a fair?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It doesn't sound like a fair...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Good Lord...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Woman: YOU! I'M BEGGING YOU, GO GET HELP!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: Well I'll be damned... 'ere's the rest of them.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: What? No, wait... we're just looking for someone.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: And you've found 'im! It's yer damn music what brought them out... Eh?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Those dirty vermin that invaded our church!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That filth what attacked our children in their beds and gave 'em the black thing!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But now you've found Conrad Malfort.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And I'm telling you, this is the last village you'll infect.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Come on!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Run, Hugo!
- Hugo: What's happening, Amicia?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Just run!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But why are they angry? Are they going to burn us too?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We have to hide, Amicia!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Here! Get inside, quickly!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: There you are!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Ah! Not that way!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Where are we going?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Come on! Just run as fast as you can!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There! The wall!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Quick! Quick!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We should never have come here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Why are they doing that?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: They think we have brought evil with us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We have to find a way out of here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Well, we got out!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: So we can leave now, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: If they don't find us again...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But you have your sling! You can protect us!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It's not that easy, Hugo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Oh...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Woman: Outsiders! Here!
- Amicia: Oh no! quickly... quickly!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The ladder! Go on, climb! You first!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: It;s doesn't look safe, Amicia!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We're running out of time! They're coming!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: It's going to break!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
- Amicia: No, no!
- Hugo: I told you!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, where are you going? Don't leave me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia, come here, this side.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: There you are.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I found this, so you can climb up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Well done. I'll get it to fall. Watch out!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come on... come on...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: There you go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Well done.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I was scared.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I'm sorry about the ladder.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It's my fault, you were right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: We need to go home.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We can't. Not without Laurentius.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia, hide!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: Well? Where the hell are they?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: Conrad! Uh... We... We've surrounded the area!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They were here a few minutes ago!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: The two of you surrounded the whole area? Get out of here!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Call the others and get those alleys blocked.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
If I catch those brats, I'll send them back to hell, piece by piece!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They won't get out of here alive!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man 1: Conrad lost his mind when his kid died.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
We have to burn innocent people, chase kids.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Meanwhile, the plague spreads through the village...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man 2: You think it's normal to have a girl and a kid running around here with things the way they are?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I bet thet came out of the church with the rest of that scum.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Oh no, not again!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager: They're here!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Which way?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I don't know!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There's no way out.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager: Over there! Quick! They're in the infected area!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Oh no!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Quickly, please!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I'm trying, I'm trying!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
It won't hold them for long...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Quickly quickly...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: They know we're here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager: Don't let them get away!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: No! It's stuck!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager: Come out of there! There's no escape!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, go through there! Open it for me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager: You lot, Conrad's coming!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: What the hell are you all doing here? Where are they?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: They've blocked it with a plank!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager: There, in Gaubert's house, but...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Can you unlock it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I'm trying...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: Get out of the way! Leave this to me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hurry!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Quick, Hugo, please!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I can't!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: I know you're in there, you brats!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, he's here!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: I'm coming! (breaking doors)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: (desparately) HUGO, DO SOMETHING!!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(doors collapse)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Come on, Amicia!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Run!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: I told you we'd meet again!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Grab them!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I... have to stop... Amicia...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: You won't get out of here alive!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Oh please, we've got to carry on! Just a littel further!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(intense music playing)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
A dead end! We're finished!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Woman: This way!...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Don't be afraid...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come in!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Shh...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager 1: Christ, this is the most infected part of the village.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Where are they?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Villager 2: Listen... We'll tell Conrad we lost them. I'm not staying here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Woman: Rest now, you're safe. They'll never come looking for you here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're soaking. There are clothes you can change into upstairs.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
in the chest in the bedroom.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Are...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...Are you sure?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thank you!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That's better.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What about you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: We have to go and find Mummy, Amicia.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Not yet.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
She told us to find Laurentius.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: But that's silly! We're going to get caught.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo! We're going to do what she told us, and that's it!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo, wait!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(sighs)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Woman: They fit you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Good.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
They belonged to my grandchildren.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Oh, my name is Clervie.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I'm Amicia, and this is Hugo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Say thank you, Hugo.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Clervie, what is happening here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: The...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...The plague...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...So many people dead...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
...and those still alive have...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But where are your parents?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: At home. They're waiting for us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: We're looking for a doctor, Laurentius.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: A doctor... Perhaps... A man did come and help at the hospice early on...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
The monks might be able to tell you more, but...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: What?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: They haven't been seen recently.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
No one goes near the church anymore.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It's all we have. We must go and see.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: You'll die there. But no one listens to old Clervie anymore, so...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Anyway, I see you have a sling.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're going to need it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
But it'll be no use to you in that state.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Go to the backyard, you'll find some new strips of leather there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
And feel free to use the workshop in the next room for your repairs.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: That's very kind of you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Feel free to use the tools by the workshop.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Right, got the tools, I just need the leather.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Leather... Right, let's get to work.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come on, keep calm and concentrate.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Right, I must go and thank Clervie.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Ah... so?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: It's a lot better.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thank you, Clervie.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thanks for everything.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man 1: So that's where you lost them?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man 2: Yeah, they won't survive long around here if you ask me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(mallet hitting on wood sound)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: What on earth are you doing?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Put that mallet down! Are you stupid or what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I AM NOT STUPID!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Don't shout!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Children, that's enough noise!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I want to see Mummy!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Shut up! You're going to get us killed!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Mummy would protect us!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: That's enough!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: I... WANT... TO... SEE... MUMMY!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: MUMMY IS DEAD, HUGO!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You'll never see her again!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Or Daddy!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Amicia!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: You're...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're lying...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: They were killed at the house.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Both of them, so shut up!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: You're lying! LYING! I HATE YOU!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Clervie: Please, stop!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Hugo, NO!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo, wait! Don't go out, you're mad!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo, come back!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
What's he doing?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: Where are they? Where the hell are they?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Oh no! He's going to get us killed!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo, please! I'm sorry! Wait!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: Demons!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: My God...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh Lord...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
HUGO!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I shouldn't have shouted! Please, listen to me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: No! Leave me alone!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: I'M SORRY!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Ahh!! No, let me go!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: Oh no! No, No!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Man: Where did you think you're off to, eh?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: No, let him go!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I... I didn't want to...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia! Amicia!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: HUGO!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'M...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'M COMING...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Please say he's alive... Please say he's alive... HUGO!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Let go of me... Let go of me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: Stop squirming! We're just waiting for your sister.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: You're not gonna put me in the ground, girl!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm gonna start with you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ah... I'm just... a bit rusty...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
There's no escape. Sooner or later...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You're a splippery one. But one hit's all it takes. Just one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Come on Conrad. Show 'em what you do best.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I know what you're like. Fine.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I can use that to my advantage.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I'm not scared of dying you know.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You took away from me the only thing I had.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Amicia: No. Don't make me do this. Please.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia... Amicia...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Conrad: Yeah, keep it up... Only death will stop me!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Enough! Let's get this over with.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hugo: Amicia...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You... you killed him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
(emotional music playing)

00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:08.896
II - STRANGERS

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:11.136
There must be a lot of people.
